A three-week decline that wipes out those gains would be extraordinary.",
            "The reason I bring this up is because of renewed interest in a column I wrote in early April. In the report, I ascertained that, based on the average lag time between the VIX’s VIX, -4.63% peak and the bear market’s eventual end, that low would occur on June 14.",

Randomness (luck, in other words) plays a huge role in the market’s shorter-term gyrations, no matter how compelling an analysis might otherwise be. Overconfidence is a vice.",
            "This episode reminds me of a famous saying from Josh Billings, a 19th century humorist: “The trouble with most folks isn't their ignorance. It's knowin' so many things that ain't so.”",
            "In my defense, I plead “nolo contendere.”",
            "Another lesson is that it’s never the case that the data all point to the same precise conclusion. For example, in that early-April column in which I suggested that the final bear market low could be June 14, based on the VIX, I presented another historical parallel that points to a final low on Aug. 7, based on the number of days between the end of the bear market’s first precipitous drop and its eventual end.",
            "This other analysis was equally plausible and just as solidly based on historical data. The jury is still out on that forecast.",
            "Still, the investment implication is that we should focus on the weight of the evidence rather than just one indicator, no matter how compelling.",
            "Some of you have suggested that I draw another lesson: The reason the market bottomed out so soon after the VIX peaked was because of the U.S. government’s extraordinary stimulus that it enacted in mid-March. I’m not so sure that’s the correct lesson.",
            "Consider each of the bear markets since 1990 in the calendar maintained by Ned Davis Research. As you can see from the accompanying chart, the VIX peak’s lead time in advance of the lows of those bear markets ranged from 0 days (in the case of the 1998 bear market that coincided with the collapse of Long Term Capital Management) to 171 days (in the case of the 2015-2016 bear market).",
            "Try as I might, I can find no correlation between the length of this lead time and the speed and magnitude of the federal government’s response.",
            "The bottom line? The lessons of history are never easy or straightforward. My best guess is that U.S. stock prices will pull back in coming months, but the March 23 lows will hold. I gave reasons for this expectation in a column earlier this month. But I’m prepared to be wrong — again.",

He said he made the journey so that he and his wife could get help caring for their 4-year-old son, which he said was not reasonably possible in London.",
            "“I don’t regret what I did, I think what I did was reasonable in these circumstances. I can understand that some people watching the media will be very upset. I understand the hardship and sacrifice the country has gone through,” he said, in response to a reporter’s question.",

            "Key Boris Johnson political adviser Dominic Cummings, speaking Monday from the garden at Downing Street, defended his controversial departure from London earlier in the coronavirus crisis. He said he had not cleared the temporary relocation of his family from London to a cottage on his parents' property in Durham with the prime minister, who himself was later hospitalized with a severe case of the coronavirus-borne disease COVID-19. He said he didn't regret the move and has not offered to resign nor considered such an offer. Cummings cited his wife's illness and child-care imperatives as motivating factors. As his wife's condition improved in Durham, he said, he became ill, as did his 4-year-old son, who ultimately was taken by ambulance to a local hospital, where he spent the night but tested negative for COVID-19. Cummings said neither he nor his wife was ever tested. He said an uncle's death from the cororonavirus-borne disease did not affect his decisions or actions, nor did he and his family have contact with the now-deceased family member. Asked by a reporter whether his actions suggested there were two sets of rules, one for the powerful and one for others, he said he felt lockdown restrictions allowed exceptions for those caring for small children. He said that, contrary to speculation, he was a supporter rather than an opponent of the U.K's lockdown policy."

Trump, meanwhile, has largely refrained from calling out Cooper as he has several other Democratic governors.",

Gov. Dan Forest, who has urged a fast reopening of state businesses."

            "Lockdowns, as broad and untargeted measures that affect the entire population, generate a huge cost. By their very nature they imply massive, damaging consequences for employment, incomes, and economic activity generally. They also directly and indirectly create health and social costs. Cancers go unscreened and therefore untreated; children go uneducated, and even go hungry. There is an alternative: targeted measures that aim at enabling normal life to continue as much as possible.",
            "Call them “smart” measures. They focus most on protecting specific groups in the population that are most at risk. There is now overwhelming evidence that the elderly and otherwise vulnerable suffer higher mortality rates than others, many of whom face very low mortality rates, and that mortality rates among children are negligible. Risks of death have risen as a result of the existence of the virus for all age groups other than the elderly, but they are still in absolute terms low. Now that the possibility of complete suppression of the disease has become unlikely, at least until a vaccine or other solution emerges, there will remain some risk for all of contracting the disease. But through suitable efforts its prevalence can be limited, and more importantly its worst outcomes can be avoided.",
            "We should start by creating a protective belt around the most vulnerable. An example, although it is being implemented very late, is the idea of testing nursing-home workers for the virus regularly. Far from minimizing risks, many nursing homes appear to have been run in a fashion that contributed to them.",
            "Smart policies should aim to enable desired behaviors by providing support for those people for whom it is most important, both by removing obstacles to taking protective actions and by creating incentives that encourage them. Economists have clunky terms for these, referring to the former as the “participation constraint” and the latter as the “incentive compatibility constraint” that is involved when getting individuals to act in preferred ways. Are elderly people leaving the home to get essentials? It should be arranged to have them delivered instead. Intergenerational households are a particular problem; younger family members may need to go out and work, but when they do, they risk infecting their parents or grandparents. The smart policy would be to replace the incomes of those younger family members so that they can stay at home, or provide them with temporary accommodation elsewhere. The costs of such measures are sure to be small in comparison to those created by an untargeted lockdown.",
            "Many other examples can be thought of, and some are being implemented as discussion mounts about how to reopen, schools, workplaces and communities. What’s missing is a way of understanding what unifies these approaches: a strategic direction that makes possible a reopening and at the same time protects lives. Although smart policies can use technology, such as testing, they are at their heart about implementing efforts in a specific and targeted way.",
            "The economic case for smart policies is that by focusing incremental efforts where there is greatest incremental risk they can achieve the goal of minimizing deaths at the least overall cost to society. Although benefits and cost are economic concepts, they should not be understood here in a narrowly economic way, but rather in terms of the overall well-being of society. If deaths can be kept to the same number or lower by more focused and less socially costly efforts than with a general lockdown, then it’s easy to see the value of the targeted approach. The case for replacing a broad lockdown with smart policies is clearer still if we consider deaths from all sources, as we should. For instance, vaccination rates in countries around the world are dropping, as outreach programs close or parents keep their children from routine doctor’s visits. Children’s vaccinations in New York City dropped by 63% over six weeks, raising the risk of an entirely preventable outbreak of whooping cough.",
            "It cannot be guaranteed that replacing lockdowns with smart measures would diminish deaths overall, even if they reduce some significant social costs, such as foregone education. But we do not always automatically prioritize the extension of lives over all other goals. The quality of life also matters, as do liberties. We take account of how decisions that might prospectively extend some lives are likely to affect others’ lives in other ways. If we did not do so, then we should spend all we have on health care. But regardless of the weights one places on different goals, if smart policies can make it possible to achieve them to a similar extent with lesser costs, then they must be considered.",

When Biden emerged on Monday, he wore a face mask, in contrast to President Donald Trump, who has refused to cover his face in public as health officials suggest.",
            "Biden and his wife, Jill, laid a wreath of white flowers tied with a white bow, and bowed their heads in silence at the park. He saluted. “Never forget the sacrifices that these men and women made,” he said after. “Never, ever, forget.”",
            "“I feel great to be out here,” Biden told reporters, his words muffled through his black cloth mask. His visit to the park was unannounced and there was no crowd waiting for him.",
            "But Biden briefly greeted a county official and another man, both wearing face masks and standing a few feet away. Biden also yelled to another, larger group standing nearby, “Thank you for your service.” His campaign says Biden has gone to the park for Memorial Day often in the past, though services were canceled Monday in the pandemic.",
            "Though low-key, the appearance was a milestone in a presidential campaign that has largely been frozen by the coronavirus outbreak. While the feasibility of traditional events such as rallies and the presidential conventions are in doubt, Biden’s emergence suggests he won’t spend the nearly five months that remain until the election entirely at home.",

            "Trump, eager to project a country coming to life even as the pandemic’s death toll approached 100,000, presided over back-to-back events at Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia and Fort McHenry in Baltimore.",
            "“ ‘We will never make any choices that put our staff or voters in harm’s way.’ ”",
            "After a wreath-laying ceremony at Arlington, Trump spoke of the fallen in remarks at the Baltimore historic site and praised the contribution of service members “on the front lines of our war against this terrible virus.”",
            "The coronavirus has upended virtually all aspects of American life and changed the terms of the election. Trump’s argument that he deserves another term in office because of the strong economy has evaporated as unemployment rises to levels not seen since the Great Depression.",
            "As a longtime senator and former vice president, Biden is trying to position himself as someone with the experience and empathy to lead the country out of a crisis. Trump counters that he is the leader who can preside over an economic rebound later this year or in 2021.",
            "Biden has adjusted to the coronavirus era by building a television studio in his home, which he’s used to make appearances on news programs, late-night shows and virtual campaign events. Some of those efforts have been marred by technical glitches and other awkward moments.",
            "Some Democratic strategists have openly worried that Biden is ceding too much ground to Trump by staying home. The president himself has knocked Biden for essentially campaigning from his basement.",
            "Biden’s advisers say they plan to return to normal campaign activities at some point, including travel to battleground states. But they’re in no hurry, preferring to defer to the advice of health experts and authorities’ stay-at-home and social distancing recommendations.",
            "At 77, Biden is among the nation’s senior population thought to be especially vulnerable to the effects of the coronavirus — though so, too, is Trump, who turns 74 next month.",
            "“We will never make any choices that put our staff or voters in harm’s way,” Biden campaign manager Jen O’Malley Dillon said recently, adding that the campaign would resume more traditional activities “when safety allows, and we will not do that a day sooner.”",
            "Trump has not resumed the large rallies that were the hallmark of his 2016 campaign and presidency but has begun traveling outside Washington in recent weeks. He visited a facility producing face masks in Arizona and a Ford plant in Michigan that has been converted to produce medical and protective equipment.",
            "Trump played golf at his club in Virginia over the weekend, hoping that others will follow his lead and return to some semblance of normal life and gradually help revive an economy in free fall.",
            "It was the president’s first trip to one of his money-making properties since March 8, when he visited his private golf club in West Palm Beach near his Mar-a-Lago private club in Palm Beach, Fla. The World Health Organization declared the coronavirus a pandemic on March 11, and Trump followed with the national emergency declaration two days later.",
            "Biden’s campaign wasted little time producing an online video offering blurry, faraway footage of Trump on the golf course, imposed over images evoking the virus ravaging the nation as the number of Americans dead from the pandemic approached 100,000. The video concluded by proclaiming: “The death toll is still rising. The president is playing golf.”",
            "Trump is next set to travel to Florida on Wednesday to watch to U.S. astronauts blast into orbit."

            "WASHINGTON (AP) — Joe Biden worked out deals with Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell. He defended Vice President Mike Pence as a “decent guy” and eulogized Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain’s “fairness, honesty, dignity, respect.”",
            "When he launched his presidential campaign, such overtures to Republicans were central to Biden’s promise to “unify the country” and “restore the soul of the nation” after defeating President Donald Trump.",
            "Now that he’s the presumptive Democratic nominee, Biden is sharpening his tone, still pitching consensus but touting a “bold agenda” aimed at mollifying progressives who remain skeptical he’ll deliver enough on health care, student loan debts and the climate crisis.",
            "The idea is to avoid repeating the party’s 2016 defeat, when Hillary Clinton struggled to unite her moderate supporters and backers of Bernie Sanders. The dynamics are different in 2020, with Democrats united in their antipathy toward Trump. But Biden’s juggling of the left wing along with mainstream Democrats and independents and Republicans disgruntled with Trump could end up as an unsuccessful attempt to be all things to all people.",
            "“It certainly seems like the approach that they’re taking right now is trying to have it both ways,” said Evan Weber, a co-founder of the Sunrise Movement, a climate action youth organization that is among the political groups working with the Biden campaign on policy proposals.",
            "For younger voters, Weber added, “Going too far in the direction of trying to appeal to a moderate narrative or a bipartisan era that most people in our generation have never experienced ... is not going to inspire a lot of confidence.”",
            "Republican pollster Whit Ayres countered that Biden’s “sweet spot” is the center-left.",
            "“You’ve got to run on who you are,” Ayres said. “If he becomes a politician of the left, it’s going to hurt his ability to consolidate the 54% of Americans who voted for someone other than Donald Trump in 2016.”",
            "Biden deflects the risks. Asked whether his recent moves mean he’ll govern as a “progressive,” Biden retorted on CNBC: “I’m going to be Joe Biden. Look at my record.”",
            "Recent interviews and campaign events reveal the nuances Biden hopes can attract support in both directions. “I think health care is a right, not a privilege,” he said on CNBC, espousing an article of faith for the left. But, he added, “I do not support Medicare for All “ single-payer insurance.",
            "Biden embraces some key principles of the Green New Deal sweeping climate plan as paths to “tens of millions of new jobs” but casts as impossible some progressives’ goal of zeroing out carbon pollution over a decade. He’s reaffirmed that he wants Republicans’ 2017 tax cuts repealed for the wealthiest individuals and corporations. But he prefers a 28% corporate tax rate – still lower than what it was before the cuts – and he’s not embraced a “wealth tax” on the fortunes of the richest Americans. He opposes the Keystone XL pipeline while stopping short of backing an outright ban on fracking.",
            "The coronavirus pandemic has influenced Biden’s thinking, as well.",
            "Once a senator who championed a balanced budget amendment, he’s aligned with congressional Democrats pushing trillions of dollars in aid for states, local governments, business and individuals. And, adopting the tenor of erstwhile rivals like Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, Biden has intensified his calls to rebuild the economy to reflect progressive values, including stamping out income inequalities baked into the pre-pandemic system.",
            "Biden aides say he’s uniquely positioned for a wide “Biden coalition” because voters prioritize experience and temperament, along with policy. The campaign defines his coalition as young, African Americans and Latinos, as well as suburban, college-educated whites, women and those disaffected by Trump.",
            "“We do not have to make a choice between one group or another group in terms of how we are going to win this,” Biden’s campaign manager Jen O’Malley Dillon said on a recent strategy call.",
            "Campaign co-chairman Cedric Richmond said Biden can stitch together otherwise irreconcilable parts of the electorate for one reason: Trump.",
            "“We have a president now with no discernible political philosophy other than what benefits him,” said Richmond, a Louisiana congressman. “Even people who are not as progressive (as Biden) and people who are more progressive at least like the consistency of knowing what a person believes in.”",
            "Anti-Trump conservatives offer similar sentiments.",
            "“We are living right now ... with the damage that can be done when a president is elected and thinks that he only has to answer to his base,” said Jennifer Horn of the Lincoln Project, which has produced online ads to help thwart Trump’s reelection.",
            "Even if Biden prevails in November, governing might prove tougher.",
            "Republicans who dislike Trump – the kind who cut deals with Sen. Biden or Vice President Biden – aren’t likely to back President Biden’s proposed “public option” health insurance expansion when they’ve never embraced the Affordable Care Act.",
            "The same goes for tax hikes and mega-spending energy packages the fossil fuel industry opposes. And within Biden’s personal base, labor unions whose jobs are anchored in existing energy markets haven’t embraced the sweeping alternatives.",
            "During the primary, Biden told skeptics in his own party he’d work with Republicans “without compromising our values,” but work to “beat them” in the 2022 midterms if that failed.",
            "Meanwhile, Weber, the Sunrise activist, argued that despite Biden’s embrace of some progressive priorities, “It’s hard to teach an old dog new tricks.”",
            "Tim Miller, a former spokesman for Republican Jeb Bush’s 2016 presidential campaign and a steadfast member of the GOP’s “Never Trump” faction, said more 2016 voters in decisive battleground states shunned both Trump and Clinton for center-right alternatives in Libertarian Gary Johnson or Independent Evan McMullen than Green Party candidate Jill Stein. Winning back just that cohort back could be enough to secure Biden to the presidency alone this cycle, he said.",
            "“I do think that there’s a concern that if he oversteps, overemphasizes a pivot to the left that could turn off certain voters who are gettable for him,” Miller said. “That’s going to be a continued tightrope through November.”"

            "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — The family of slain Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi announced Friday they have forgiven his Saudi killers, giving legal reprieve to the five government agents who’d been sentenced to death for an operation that cast a cloud of suspicion over the kingdom’s crown prince.",
            "“We, the sons of the martyr Jamal Khashoggi, announce that we forgive those who killed our father as we seek reward from God Almighty,” wrote one of his sons, Salah Khashoggi, on Twitter.",
            "Salah Khashoggi, who lives in Saudi Arabia and has received financial compensation from the royal court for his father’s killing, explained that forgiveness was extended to the killers during the last nights of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan in line with Islamic tradition to offer pardons in cases allowed by Islamic law.",
            "Related:Democrats say fired State Department watchdog was probing Pompeo role in multibillion-dollar arms sale that violated Congress’s will",
            "The announcement was largely expected because the trial in Saudi Arabia left the door open for reprieve by ruling in December that the killing was not premeditated. That finding was in line with the government’s official explanation of Khashoggi’s slaying that he was killed accidentally in a brawl by agents trying to forcibly return him to Saudi Arabia.",
            "Prior to his killing, Khashoggi had written critically of Saudi Arabia’s crown prince in columns for the Washington Post. He’d been living in exile in the United States for about a year as Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman oversaw a crackdown in Saudi Arabia on human rights activists, writers and critics of his devastating war in Yemen.",
            "In October 2017, a team of 15 Saudi agents was dispatched to Turkey to meet Khashoggi in the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul for what he thought was an appointment to pick up documents needed to wed his Turkish fiance. The group included a forensic doctor, intelligence and security officers and individuals who worked for the crown prince’s office.",
            "Turkish officials allege Khashoggi was killed and then dismembered with a bone saw. The body has not been found. Turkey, a rival of Saudi Arabia, apparently had the Saudi Consulate bugged and has shared audio of the killing with the CIA, among others.",
            "The grisly killing, which took place as his Turkish fiance waited for him outside the building, drew international condemnation of Prince Mohammed.",
            "The 34-year-old prince, who has the support of his father King Salman, denies any involvement. U.S. intelligence agencies, however, say an operation like this could not have happened without his knowledge and the Senate has blamed the crown prince for the murder.",
            "After initially offering shifting accounts of what transpired, and under intense international and Turkish pressure, Saudi prosecutors eventually settled on the explanation that Khashoggi had been killed by Saudi agents in an operation masterminded by two of the crown prince’s top aides at the time. Neither was found guilty in trial, however.",
            "In addition to the five who had been sentenced to execution, the Saudi trial concluded last year that three other people were found guilty of covering up the crime and were sentenced to a combined 24 years in prison. In all, 11 people were put on trial in Saudi Arabia for the killing.",
            "Saudi media outlet Arab News sought to clarify Friday that the announcement made by Khashoggi’s sons may spare the convicted killers from execution, but does not mean they will go unpunished.",
            "In an interview in September with CBS’ “60 Minutes,” Prince Mohammed said he takes “full responsibility as a leader in Saudi Arabia.” But he insisted that he had no knowledge of the operation, saying he cannot keep close track of the country’s millions of employees."

            "The most visible may be that the price of oil, a tangible commodity, even if one that’s currently not much in demand, can actually go negative. But there’s another realization dawning on market participants: letting mom-and-pop investors have access to financial products that were previously the domain of sophisticated traders may not be a win-win after all.",
            "“We always say ETFs have democratized investing and have allowed investors to access just about every asset class, and I’ve always thought that’s wonderful,” said Nate Geraci, president of Kansas City-based advisory The ETF Store.",
            "“Choice is important. But it’s a double-edged sword. We’ve put extremely complex investments in an easy to access wrapper.”",
            "Retail investors piled into the biggest and most visible exchange-traded fund that tracks oil price movements even as the price – and the fund’s share values – careened downward.",
            "The United States Oil Fund USO, -3.87% is now down 80% in the year to date, even as the number of investors holding the ETF in a Robinhood brokerage account has increased more than 22 times in that period. USO managers spent several weeks in May shuffling the fund’s makeup nearly every day to try to stay above water.",
            "See:Retail investors are getting ‘hosed’ with the biggest oil ETF down more than 30% this week",
            "And USO, while the most high-profile ETF blow-up, wasn’t the only fracture. Eight oil exchange-traded products closed as a result of the volatility, according to Morningstar data, and in the year to date more ETFs have closed than opened, for the first time in years.",
            "And the unsettled financial markets of the past few months have led several market index providers to postpone the regularly scheduled rebalancing of their portfolios. As Geraci put it, index providers deciding to tread lightly is small potatoes compared to the near-daily contortions of USO managers just to stay alive, but skipping routine maintenance because markets are choppy “is not what (the indexes) were supposed to do.”",
            "Now a consensus may be emerging around the idea that there should be protections for investors in ETFs made up of riskier assets, just as for those trading the assets directly. As ETF industry veteran Dave Nadig told MarketWatch in mid-April, of USO, “I would argue that you should not be investing in this if you are not allowed to invest in the underlying assets.”",
            "In USO’s case, that refers to futures contracts. Investors who want to trade futures through a brokerage must be screened and receive permission.",
            "But there’s also reason to think other ETF products, such as those that use leverage, can be just as risky.",
            "“It’s pretty clear that a lot of individual investors underestimate the downside risks of many of the investments they make, and that’s especially true with regard to leverage,” said Rawley Heimer, a Boston College professor whose research focuses on the decisions retail investors make in financial markets.",
            "“A lot of the evidence shows that people don’t quite understand how leverage affects the risk and return of their investment and don’t internalize the downside risk that comes with it,” Heimer said.",
            "While it may be tempting to suggest any adult smart enough to set up a brokerage account and start trading sophisticated instruments should know what they’re getting into, Heimer and Geraci argue otherwise.",
            "“There are absolutely reasons to try to protect uninformed investors from themselves,” Heimer said, and not just for their own individual welfare. The presence of more unsophisticated actors in the market “can exacerbate market volatility, it can make markets less informative, and it can lead to capital shortfalls for the financial institutions,” he said.",
            "“The industry as a whole has to do a better job of educating on the risks,” Geraci said in an interview. “Without the proper education it has the potential to be a black eye for the industry.”",
            "Geraci thinks subtle labelling changes may make a difference. “’The United States Oil Fund’ should have been ‘the United States Oil Futures Fund’,” he said. He also thinks earlier efforts by industry titan BlackRock to coordinate clearer labelling on different types of exchange-traded products, such as ETFs, for funds, or ETNs, for notes, should be reconsidered.",
            "(Exchange-traded notes, which are actually bank-issued bonds, have a high-profile blow-up in their own history, as when a volatility gauge from Credit Suisse lost all its value and closed down in 2018.)",
            "Related:Here’s the right way to trade ETFs",
            "But Heimer says it’s not clear whether investors are best helped by more education, or by caps on their trading. Like Nadig, he’s in favor of more hurdles for anyone interested in investing in non-traditional assets.",
            "Wednesday marks the 10-year anniversary of the “Flash Crash”, a day on which stock markets plunged suddenly, losing an amount that was at that time its biggest intraday drop ever, before recovering slightly. In today’s terms, that would equate to a 2,157-point drop for the Dow, according to Dow Jones Market Data.",
            "ETF industry participants have spent the past decade arguing that the crush of new money and fresh investors into mostly passively-managed ETFs won’t be responsible for big market-wide glitches, and should not be feared. In fact, many point to ETF resilience throughout the March volatility as proof that the products are safe.",
            "Still, the USO episode gives Heimer pause. “As all this retail money has gone into ETFs, it puts prices pressure on the underlying assets as well as the rest of the market,” he said. “The ETF is the new individual stock in some respects.”",
            "Related:Investors are paying more to short sell ETFs. Here’s what that tells us about the market."

            "My wife and I are taking a phased approach to early/semi-retirement. She cut back to working part time in 2012, five years prior to my retirement. She continues to work in that same role since I retired in 2017.",
            "Making changes gradually gave us the courage to begin making major life transitions sooner than we otherwise would have. How does it impact our tax situation compared to full early retirement?",
            "It was initially my intention to share numbers from our actual tax returns over several periods: a household with two full-time incomes, one full-time and one part-time income, and then one part-time income only. The goal was to provide an apples-to-apples comparison of taxation in these different scenarios. It quickly became apparent how challenging that would be.",
            "My last year of work was 2017. In 2018, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act significantly changed the tax code. Our personal situation changed as well. My wife’s income has steadily increased each year. My writing provides some self-employed income. As such, I am now responsible for paying both the employer and employee portions of Social Security and Medicare taxes that I hadn’t as an employee.",
            "We switched to a high-deductible health plan in 2017 and opened a Health Savings Account (HSA) that offers new tax advantages. Prior to that we’d never been eligible for a HSA.",
            "Read:Choosing an HSA can save you money now and make you even more later",
            "We rented out our current residence during the second half of 2017 and first half of 2018, financed by a home equity loan with a variable interest rate. After breaking even in 2017, we sustained a substantial loss in 2018 when the interest rate increased. The loss decreased our taxable income that year.",
            "Finally, we moved from Pennsylvania to Utah in July 2018. Our state income tax rate increased from 3.07% to 4.95%.",
            "It’s easier to demonstrate the tax implications of semi-retirement using a scenario based on our numbers while controlling key variables. This allows an apples-to-apples comparison to demonstrate key principles.",
            "The assumptions about this couple are:",
            "• They file taxes as married filing jointly with no dependents",
            "• Each individual earns a full-time equivalent of $90,000/year",

            "The maximum contribution to a 401(k) account is $19,500 per person. Since both partners are working, the couple’s total contribution is $39,000, which lowers adjusted gross income (AGI) to $154,200.",
            "Subtract the standard deduction of $24,800 to arrive at a taxable income of $129,400. Subtracting the $12,000 of qualified dividends gives $117,400 of income taxable at ordinary income tax rates.",
            "The first $19,750 is taxed at 10% for $1,975. The next $60,500 is taxed at 12% for $7,260. The final $37,150 is taxed at 22% for $8,173. The total is $17,408.",

            "Cutting back one spouse’s earnings by 25% reduces the household pretax income by 12.5%. But that income would have been taxed at the highest marginal tax rate, so what does this do to after-tax income?",
            "The couple’s total earned income in this scenario is reduced to $157,500. Total income with investments is $170,700. Subtracting $39,000 for 401(k) contributions lowers AGI to $131,700.",
            "Subtracting the standard deduction of $24,800 leaves $106,900 of taxable income. After subtracting the $12,000 in qualified dividends, it leaves $94,900 taxed as ordinary income.",
            "The first $19,750 is again taxed at 10% for $1,975. Then next $60,500 is taxed at 12% for $7,260. Only $14,650 is now taxed at their marginal rate of 22% for $3,223. The total is $12,458.",

            "The third scenario reflects the impact of the full-time spouse retiring fully and the other spouse continuing to work 30 hours a week. This is what happened when I left my career in 2017. When married filing jointly, you can obtain a similar outcome if each partner worked 15 hours per week.",
            "Total earned income in this scenario is $67,500. Adding in investment income brings it to $80,700. Since only one spouse is working, they can only contribute $19,500 to a 401(k), lowering AGI to $61,200.",
            "Subtracting the standard deduction of $24,800 leaves $36,400 taxable income. After subtracting the $12,000 in qualified dividends, it leaves $24,400 taxed as ordinary income.",
            "The first $19,750 is again taxed at 10% for $1,975. Only $4,650 is taxed at the lower marginal rate of 12% for $558. The total is $2,533.",
            "Qualified dividends are taxed at a rate of 0% for couples married filing jointly if taxable income falls below $80,000. Thus no tax is owed on this $12,000 of investment income.",

            "The ability to contribute to Roth IRA accounts and the ability to deduct traditional IRA accounts are dependent on your income in a given year. I couldn’t keep these variables constant for a fair apples-to-apples comparison.",
            "Also, tax deductions are always more valuable when in the highest marginal tax rates. Roth IRAs are always more valuable for those with low enough income that they don’t pay federal income tax. In between, there is a gray area that is highly dependent on your personal situation.",

            "Before I dove into the numbers on Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies, I thought the biggest drawback to semi-retirement was that having earned income would make health insurance unaffordable.",
            "Our MAGI (modified adjusted gross income) last year was $73,000. Plugging that number into the Kaiser Family Foundation Health Insurance Marketplace Calculator with our specific geographic location and family demographics (two adults and one child) reveals that we would receive a subsidy of $725 per month and pay $595 a month for a silver plan through the ACA.",
            "This is more than we pay to purchase insurance through my wife’s employer. But it is still reasonable.",
            "Because we weren’t buying insurance through the ACA, we did nothing to optimize our MAGI. We could have contributed about $15,000 more to my wife’s 401(k) and contributed $12,000 to traditional rather than Roth IRAs.",
            "Lowering our MAGI by $27,000, from $73,000 to $46,000, would drastically increase our subsidy and lower our premium costs. We would pay only $270 a month while receiving $1,050 per month in subsidies.",
            "We could then meet our spending needs by selling off investments with long-term capital gains which would be taxed at 0%. However, the capital gains do count toward MAGI.",

            "The Chinese e-commerce giant reported better-than-expected results for its March quarter before the opening bell, clearing a lowered bar after the COVID-19 crisis pressured its business and prompted analysts to lower their forecasts in the months leading up to Alibaba’s BABA, -5.87% report.",
            "Read: Alibaba points to ‘steady recovery since March’ as earnings, revenue top expectations",
            "Chief Executive Daniel Zhang said on the company’s earnings call that Alibaba saw “signs of recovery in certain major markets starting in April” but that the business also faces “uncertainties.”",
            "Among the positive points is that gross merchandise volume since the start of April has shown “year-on-year growth at a similar rate to the December quarter’s level,” Zhang said. Alibaba saw a 8% decline in revenue from its local consumer services businesses, but volume growth for the company’s food-delivery business swung into positive territory during April.",
            "While Alibaba hasn’t seen any major changes in terms of the “consumption power” of Chinese consumers on its platform, according to Zhang, the company has noticed some differences in purchasing trends, including heightened food purchases and shifts in beauty preferences. “When ladies wear facemasks, the need for makeup is getting lower,” he said, though skin-care demand is still “very strong.”",
            "Don’t miss: Alibaba sees growth of its business-to-business platform accelerate amid COVID-19",
            "Alibaba argued that the global nature of the COVID-19 crisis and the simmering tensions between the U.S. and China represent potential challenges ahead.",
            "“Although China has made good progress in fighting and controlling the spread of the coronavirus with most business reopening and people returning to normal life, the stretch of the pandemic is still looming in the rest of the world, and the timing and the pace of recovery is still uncertain,” Zhang said.",
            "For the fiscal year ahead that ends next March, Alibaba expects to generate more than RMB650 billion ($91 billion) in revenue, in line with the FactSet consensus that called for RMB659 billion.",
            "Chief Financial Officer Maggie Wu said that it was “hard for us to factor in” uncertainties around vaccine timing or whether there will be a second wave of COVID-19 infections and that the company’s forecast “basically reflects assumptions that we believe to be reasonable today” based on recent hints about the recovery rates and growth levels of Alibaba’s various businesses.",
            "She also addressed a recent bill that passed the U.S. Senate and that aims to place greater auditing restrictions on foreign companies listing their shares on U.S. exchanges. Wu said that Alibaba’s financial statements are “prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP” standards and are audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers.",
            "“We will endeavor to comply with any legislation whose aim is to protect and bring transparency to investors who buy securities on U.S. stock exchanges,” she said.",

            "This week’s decline in rates was prompted by comments from the Federal Reserve. “Mortgage rates slid today after a sobering assessment from the Federal Reserve of the tough economic road ahead,” said George Ratiu, senior economist at Realtor.com. The central bank downgraded its economic forecast ahead of its meeting last month, according to notes released Wednesday.",
            "The Federal Reserve indicated that they would keep interest rates low for an extended period of time to help the economy bounce back from the coronavirus pandemic. But Fed officials have warned that the central bank’s effectiveness in addressing the economic impact of the outbreak could be limited if the U.S. doesn’t resolve public health issues.",

            "Historically, mortgage rates have roughly followed the direction of long-term bond yields, including the yield on the 10-year Treasury note TMUBMUSD10Y, 0.693%. That relationship has diverged somewhat throughout the coronavirus crisis.",

            "While bond yields and mortgage rates have both fallen throughout the outbreak, mortgage rates have not decreased as much as bond yields would suggest. That’s in large part due to friction in the mortgage industry caused by the massive wave of forbearance requests that servicers have received.",
            "With millions of Americans skipping their monthly mortgage payments, firms have had to tighten their lending activity to cope, rather than drop rates.",

            "“Borrowers with great credit who are seeking a straightforward loan are being quoted at significantly lower rates than less creditworthy borrowers, resulting in a range of rates that tells a broader story than just the average,” Speakman said."

            "The coronavirus pandemic sent shock waves throughout the real-estate industry. But does that make now a good time to put in an offer on a property?",
            "The answer to that question will largely depend on what you plan to do with the home — particularly if you’re an investor.",
            "“It’s a good time to buy an investment property if you can find inventory at a good price,” said Daren Blomquist, vice president of market economics at real-estate website Auction.com.",
            "“ ‘You shouldn’t expect a low price and that you may not have a lot of options to choose from.’ ”",
            "But finding homes at a good price could be something of a challenge.",
            "When the coronavirus pandemic began to trigger stay-at-home orders across the country, it upended the home-buying process.",
            "Companies that specialize in buying and selling homes for a profit put a temporary pause on operations, and real-estate agents had to innovate, moving toward virtual open houses and remote closings to adhere to social-distancing protocols.",
            "With the backdrop of these changes — plus the rapid rise in unemployment — sellers responded by pulling their listings. New listings were down more than 44% in April compared with the previous year, according to data from Realtor.com.",
            "That meant there were roughly 189,000 fewer homes on the market last month than during the same period in 2019. At the same time, new-home construction slowed in April as many builders became concerned about the state of the housing industry amid the pandemic.",
            "Don’t miss:Only 50% of Americans believe it’s a good time to buy a home, an all-time low, Gallup poll says",
            "“That doesn’t mean it’s a bad time to buy an investment property, just that you shouldn’t expect a low price and that you may not have a lot of options to choose from,” said Danielle Hale, chief economist at Realtor.com.",
            "Before the coronavirus crisis began, economists had warned that the U.S. housing market was starved for supply. Years of slow home-building activity in the wake of the financial crisis has meant that the number of homes for sale was falling well short of demand.",
            "See also: The mortgage industry is facing a crisis because of the coronavirus — and borrowers could fall through the cracks",
            "The apprehension among home sellers and builders could exacerbate that problem — especially if the housing market sees a V-shaped recovery. Indeed, there is already evidence that buyers are returning to the market, particularly in states where stay-at-home orders have been loosened.",
            "“ Another factor making it harder for people to score a deal on an investment property: The lack of foreclosures. ”",
            "Another factor making it harder for people to score a deal on an investment property: The lack of foreclosures, due to foreclosure moratoriums. “We’re seeing many investors who primarily acquired at the courthouse foreclosure auction migrate to buy bank-owned (REO) homes via online auction, which also provides the added benefit of allowing them to buy with no in-person interaction,” Blomquist said. The added competition for these homes could drive up the prices.",
            "However, there are some categories of properties that could start to come on the market in droves in the coming months. The downturn in travel has wiped out the bookings for people who owned vacation homes and rent them out on websites like Airbnb and VRBO.",
            "Many of these people relied on the income generated from these short-term rentals to pay for their mortgage. “I don’t think many of those folks have the reserves that Marriott or that Hilton does,” Glenn Kelman, Chief Executive of Redfin RDFN, +7.20% told MarketWatch. “Investors who own Airbnb properties are looking for immediate liquidity.”",
            "Similarly, many mom-and-pop landlords are struggling as tenants miss rent payments. Like vacation-home owners, those payments tend to go directly toward the mortgage. Savvy investors could find a solid buying opportunity by making an attractive offer to these property owners.",
            "“ ‘Looking at the housing market right now, it’s hard to say that prices are low.’ ”",
            "But investors in the housing market should also consider their end goal. Those looking to buy a home and hold onto it in the long term, particularly as a rental property, won’t face as much risk. Indeed, 64% of investors who primarily buy investment properties as rentals said they planned to increase or keep their acquisitions, despite the pandemic, according to a recent survey from Auction.com.",
            "It’s a different question for someone looking to buy a home and then immediately flip it. That could turn into a very risky bet, given that it’s not clear where real-estate prices will go. “For investments, you always want to buy low and sell high,” Hale said. “Looking at the housing market right now, it’s hard to say that prices are low.”",
            "While many economists predict that home prices will continue to rise, much will depend on the economy’s ability to bounce back from the pandemic. Home price appreciation has slowed so far, Hale said, but prices are still rising.",
            "“What makes this time unique in recent history — and truly unprecedented — is the uncertainty in the weeks and months ahead,” said Mike DelPrete, an independent real-estate industry analyst. “No one knows with any degree of certainty what will happen. There are a lot of unknowns, and the overall pandemic situation has to play its hand.”"

            "Rising tensions between the U.S. and China over culpability for the coronavirus pandemic have helped reignite debates over trade, technology transfer and whether Chinese companies should be able to raise money in public U.S. markets, but the next front in the conflict between the world’s two largest economies could be over a brewing emerging-market debt crisis.",
            "As a deepening global economic downturn threatens the ability of poorer nations to service sovereign debt, the G20 group of wealthy nations agreed in April to freeze loan repayments on bilateral loans, China is trying to make sure that its Belt and Road Initiative that has driven at least $350 billion in infrastructure loans to poorer nations is not threatened, according to Benn Steil, director of international economics at the Council on Foreign Relations .",
            "“China signed on to the G-20 pledge, but later said that loans that are issued by China’s Export-Import Bank were not part of it,” Steil told MarketWatch, pointing to statements by Song Wei, a Chinese Ministry of Commerce Official in the Global Times, a newspaper aligned with the Communist Party of China. “You would have to be expert enough to know that Exim bank is effectively the piggy bank for BRI.”",
            "U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo criticized China’s lending policy with respect to Africa in particular in a recent telephone press conference. “There’s an enormous amount of debt that the Chinese Communist party has imposed on African countries all across the region,” he said adding that African nations should seek relief “on some deals that have incredibly onerous terms that will impact the African people for an awfully long time.”",
            "Meanwhile, a group of 16 Republican Senators issued a letter to Pompeo and U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin calling on them to “pressure Chinese institutions to renegotiate the underlying debt of developing countries without a political quid pro quo,” and alleging that BRI loans are not made based on economic considerations alone, but for political leverage, calling the program “debt-trap diplomacy”",
            "The senators cited the example of the takeover of the Sri Lankan Port of Hambantota by a state-owned Chinese firm under a 99-year lease after the country was unable to “repay over $1 billion of Chinese debt” related to its construction.",
            "Others argue that the BRI program is a benign effort to boost economic growth at home and in the Greater China region, and that most of these deals are mutually beneficial. Deborah Bräutigam, director of the China Africa Research initiative at Johns Hopkins University has argued that China has long welcomed foreign investment and expertise, and Belt and Road is simply China exporting the very same tools to poorer countries around the world.",
            "“BRI slots neatly into low-income countries’ development aspirations. China has excess foreign exchange, construction capacity, and mid-level manufacturing and needs to send all of these overseas,” she wrote in the American Interest. “The developing countries of Asia alone require infrastructure investments of about $1.7 trillion per year to maintain growth, reduce poverty, and mitigate climate change. In Africa, on the periphery of the BRI, the African Development Bank estimates annual infrastructure requirements to be $130 to $170 billion.”",
            "Total emerging and frontier market debt has risen from roughly 75% of GDP to more than 100% in 2020, according to the International Monetary Fund, at the same time that credit ratings for issuers have fallen and the share of foreign owners of emerging market debt has risen.",
            "“A majority of low-income economies were moving to a high risk of debt distress toward the end of last year, so it just stands to reason that any strain — let alone the kind of economic shock that we expect from this crisis — would lead to a reckoning of some sort,” Scott Morris, senior fellow at the Center for Global Development told MarketWatch.",
            "After the onset of the most recent economic downturn, $100 billion in capital has fled emerging-market economies, while remittances from wealthy countries to poor is expected to fall another $100 billion over the course of the year, according to the IMF.",
            "These dynamics have caused the interest rates at which poorer countries can borrow money to skyrocket and raised concerns over a looming emerging market debt crisis. Interest rates investors demand for emerging market debt have risen in recent months, with the spread between the yield on the JP Morgan Emerging Market Bond index and 10-year U.S. Treasury note TMUBMUSD10Y, 0.693% rising from 2.9% in December to 5.4% Thursday, according to Bloomberg.",
            "China’s One Belt One Road Project has been a major driver of emerging market debt, particularly in Africa, according to Andrew Davenport, chief operating officer of international affairs consulting firm RWR Advisory Group.",
            "Davenport said that the ongoing coronavirus epidemic could be a moment of truth for BRI. “What China doesn’t want to have happen, even if attributed to the virus, is for these countries to be unable to repay their debts, and that be seen as the epilogue to the Belt and Road experiment,” he said.",
            "”The U.S. has long said that these loans weren’t driven by market principles, were not constructive, and in many instances, were serving the strategic power projection purposes of Beijing,” he added. “The inability of some of these countries to repay their Chinese loans could be seen as legitimizing that message. That’s the narrative China is anxious to avoid.”",
            "Harvard University economist Kenneth Rogoff said, however, that to view the coming emerging-market debt crisis through the lens of U.S.-China power politics is to underestimate the scope of the problem. While the G20 moratorium on emerging market debt was a start, even if China engages in widespread BRI loan restructuring, more will have to be done, including by U.S.-led institutions like the World Bank.",
            "“This is an opportunity” for the U.S. to counter China’s “agenda of projecting world power,” he said, by taking the lead on this issue and making a massive push for debt restructuring by governments, multinational institutions and private lenders.",
            "“There’s so little recognition in Washington there may need to be massive humanitarian relief around the world. We see all these trillion dollar budgets, but I’ve seen nothing about foreign aid,” Rogoff added. “We’re almost certainly looking at the great depression in emerging markets.”"

            "At the end of 2018, China opened the longest sea bridge in the world, linking Hong Kong with other mainland cities surrounding the Pearl River Delta. In spite of the engineering fanfare, the bridge was seen by many at the time as a subtle political attempt to integrate and absorb Hong Kong into the mainland. This week, at the annual National People’s Congress in Beijing, the Chinese Communist Party abandoned subtlety by announcing it would pass a national security law this summer.",
            "The law will extend to Hong Kong the legal system and security regulations that prevail elsewhere in China. The Hong Kong announcement upended the expectations of many China watchers who expected a largely economic agendain the wake of the pandemic. The Hong Kong we have known will never be the same, and the reverberations triggered by this move have only just started.",
            "The Hong Kong announcement also distracted from Premier Li Keqiang’s report to the NPC, which is traditionally the setting for the announcement of the government’s GDP growth target. After the plunge in first-quarter GDP, the government decided to abandon the target for this year. Many economists insist this should ideally be a precedent, allowing the government to focus more on other economic priorities, but this may be wishful thinking. Instead, the government announced other targets. ",
            "The party wants to sustain the urban unemployment rate at 6%, but the actual level of unemployment may be more than three times as high, taking account of mismeasurement and the tens of millions of migrant workers unable to return to or find new work and who are not counted. It wants to create 9 million new jobs this year, down from an 11 million target last year, but Li acknowledged “hundreds of millions” of workers are underemployed or, in effect, gig workers, and the annual absorption of 8.5 million new graduates every summer will be a challenge to say the least.",
            "The long-standing 3% of GDP limit to the central government’s fiscal deficit is going to be breached as the government is targeting a deficit ratio of 3.6%. Yet taking account of roughly $140 billion of new “coronavirus” bonds, about $550 billion of new special quota bonds issued by local governments to help finance tax and fee cuts and more spending on infrastructure, and broader public sector and off-budget liabilities and revenue shortfalls, China’s so-called augmented fiscal deficit could rise sharply to 15-16% of GDP. More debt isn’t a uniquely Western problem.",
            "More debt in China, though, has been a particular problem. The government has been attempting since 2017 to curtail the growth of quasi-fiscal credit creation by banks and nonbanking financial institutions. It is reluctant to go down the route it trod to great cost in 2008-09 and 2014-15. Nevertheless, current circumstances have already led to an increase from 10% to 12% in broad credit creation, and debt restraint isn’t top of the agenda now. We should expect the People’s Bank of China to allow credit expansion to pick up further this year, even if this results, as is likely, in further bad debt and resource misallocation in the next year or two.",
            "The government announced other initiatives or commitments concerning small- and medium-sized enterprises, and vague ownership reforms for state enterprises. But there was little to support the “markets” and the reform rhetoric that had preceded the NPC. By and large, the Chinese government, like others, is in disaster-relief mode, and relying on traditional state-directed investment, infrastructure, and borrowing tools to deal with a very untraditional economic crisis. Structural headwinds were already blowing strong before the pandemic.",
            "It is a matter of conjecture whether the Hong Kong announcement was timed to deflect attention away from Li’s economic report. The party leadership must have been planning how to address Hong Kong for a while. The revival of Hong Kong’s protest movement, which had slowed during the height of the pandemic, was undoubtedly a catalyst. But the announcement bears the marks of desperation.

            "Although the Public Security and National Security ministries have operated covertly in Hong Kong, they will no longer be constrained. We can expect they will be diligent in trying to suppress dissent, curtail freedom of expression and assembly, and introduce arbitrary detention and other forms of repression. Quite how this will affect the operational management and environment for the thousands of foreign businesses that are represented in Hong Kong remains to be seen. China may wish them to stay and to preserve the region’s status as an international financial center, but it is doubtful this is compatible with mainland China’s legal and security rules and regulations.",
            "The reactions of the United States and others will be important, following the accumulation of trade, commerce, technology, and financial restrictions in rapidly deteriorating bilateral relations with China. Under the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act passed by Congress last year, Beijing is held responsible in an annual assessment for maintaining the autonomy of Hong Kong. Sanctions are available against those deemed to have committed violations, and Hong Kong’s special status in terms of trade liable to be withdrawn. ",

Chris Van Hollen and Pat Toomey have tabled a bipartisan bill to sanction officials and entities—that is, banks and financial institutions—that enforce new national security regulations in the Special Administrative Region. At a time when China needs foreign direct investment  inflows and its banks need U.S. dollar funding, financial sanctions would open a new front in what is already a fractious relationship with China. Beijing cannot have been unaware of this, but whether it understands the consequences is a moot point.",

            "Central bank actions have for the most part suppressed market volatility since the financial crisis of 2008. This is part of a deliberate strategy to lower risk, which is measured by volatility. Reduced risk, it’s hoped, will facilitate borrowing to boost growth. Yet these measures have failed in their primary objective, instead encouraging speculation — which now exerts significant influence over markets and prices. ",
            "Artificially low volatility has driven a wide range of investment strategies which generate small returns under stable conditions but are vulnerable to large losses under stressful conditions. Depending on how it is measured, an amount of more than $2 trillion and as much as $8 trillion may be exposed in this way.",
            "The strategies themselves vary. Investors including institutions, mutual funds, hedge funds and high-net-worth individuals explicitly sell options to generate premium income either directly or using call- and put-writing programs. ",
            "Many popular fund strategies implicitly sell options. For example, risk parity programs allocate funds across different assets using quantitative models. As risk, measured as volatility, declines, portfolios are biased towards riskier assets. If volatility increases, portfolios favor safer assets including bonds and cash. In addition to the price exposure to the underlying assets, the strategy assumes the risk of changes in volatility as well as the correlation between the assets, both of which can be highly variable. Many common quantitative strategies, like risk premia, commodity trading advisor funds and factor investments have similar dynamics.",
            "Private investors also have purchased large volumes of structured products that promise high coupons in return for selling options on shares, rates, currencies or commodities. Many of these structures embed exotic options, including digital or knock-in knock-out options.",
            "“ Companies with active share repurchase programs funded by low-cost debt are de facto selling put options on their own shares. ”",
            "The largest exposure is via share buyback programs and risky corporate debt, which entail implicit sales of options. Companies with active share repurchase programs funded by low-cost debt are de facto selling put options on their own shares. Since 2009, the purchases, totaling about $4 trillion, account for as much as half of all earnings-per-share increases and around one-third of price gains. Reduction in shares outstanding and increased debt makes firms vulnerable to volatility increases such as that resulting from an external shock like the coronavirus pandemic.",
            "Purchase of risky debt equates to selling a put option on shares of the issuer. Where the firm’s asset value falls below the level of outstanding debt, equity is wiped out and the losses transferred to creditors. This is most evident in riskier, more leveraged companies. In recent years, the largest growth in borrowing has been in the lowest investment grade categories, high-yield debt and leveraged loans.",
            "The explicit or implicit sale of options poses significant risks. Higher volatility translates into losses. In the first place, there is a mark-to-market loss, particularly with sold options. This affects explicit sold options but also in cases where the optionality is implicit. For example, higher volatility increases the risk of default of leveraged companies, which translates into wider credit spreads causing mark-to-market loses for holders. Volatility also increases debt costs and affects the ability to refinance borrowings.",
            "Bigger losses come about due to the need to rebalance portfolios, known as gamma risk. In effect, if there is a large movement in asset prices, that is, real volatility, then portfolios based on selling options must be rebalanced. This typically requires pro-cyclical trading, selling when markets fall and buying when markets rise. This exacerbates market gyrations. ",
            "Read: Out-of-whack stock and bond prices say something troubling about the coronavirus economy",
            "The position is worse where, as generally happens, under conditions of instability, prices jump or are discontinuous. Rebalancing cannot occur as prices change but with a time lag, which means that losses are larger. For exotic options, the rebalancing risk can be huge.",
            "The explicit or implicit use of options entails leverage. For example, in 2018, a dislocation in a $50 billion market of volatility funds resulted in an estimated $5 trillion overall loss in global stocks — although in this case much of the losses were recovered provided positions had not been liquidated.",
            "Volatility works in conjunction with liquidity and the level of interest rates. Cheap and abundant money and low rates dampen volatility and increases the values of risky assets. If credit conditions tighten and rates increase, then it feeds into higher volatility, setting off a chain of losses.",
            "The exposures are linked through complex feedback loops. Increasing volatility causes losses and triggers rebalancing, which amplifies price and volatility moves. Destabilization of credit markets feeds into the first loop, for example, reducing stock buybacks and general risk aversion, heightening volatility shifts. Investment losses lead to fund withdrawals, which adds liquidity pressures into the mix. ",
            "Volatility, correlation, and volatility-of-volatility are important because they highlight how distorted economic reality has become. Savers and those charged with managing people’s savings simply can’t meet hurdle rates of return in this environment. They have deliberately or unwittingly taken on additional risk to avoid seeing their purchasing power devalued. These investments may provide short-term excess returns but contain hidden fragilities that may be ruthlessly exposed in the near future.",

            "Those visions may come to pass, but you’re in for a long wait. In fact, only if you’re willing not to touch your money for 10 years — until 2030 — should you even think of putting new money into the stock market right now.",
            "I say this not because I think it will take that long for the S&P 500 SPX, +0.23% to recover from the coronavirus pandemic. My advice instead derives from the historical odds. After holding stocks for at least 10 years, you have an 80% chance of outperforming bonds. If a one-out-of-five chance of lagging bonds is still too high, you need to be prepared to leave your equity investments untouched for even longer than 10 years.",
            "Consider the percentage of times since 1801 in which the U.S. stock market outperformed bonds, as calculated by Jeremy Siegel, the finance professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania and author of “Stocks For The Long Run.”",
            "For example, as you can see from the chart below, stocks have outperformed bonds in 71% of all rolling five-year periods since 1801. Even on the assumption that the future will be like the past, a generous assumption as I have argued elsewhere, that means there’s a 29% chance that the money you put into the stock market today will not outperform bonds over the next five years. With bond yields currently so low, that is a disheartening prospect indeed.",
            "I focus on five years because many advisers and financial planners default to that holding period when pressed for the minimum length of time investors need to leave untouched any money they put into the stock market. But a 29% chance of lagging bonds is unacceptably high.",
            "What if you want a 95% probability of stocks outperforming bonds? That’s the threshold statisticians frequently use to determine if the odds of failure are acceptably low. As you can see from the chart, the lesson of the past two centuries is that you must be willing to hold your investments for more than 20 years.",
            "When confronted by these statistics, some would argue that the odds of stocks beating bonds in coming years surely must be higher than what I am presenting here, since current bond yields are so low. But the data don’t necessarily back up this argument. Though bonds’ long-term prospects currently look mediocre at best, the same goes for the stock market (as I argued in a recent column).",
            "Sobering as these statistics are, they may very well overstate the odds of stocks outperforming bonds. That’s the conclusion of research conducted by Edward McQuarrie, a professor emeritus at the Leavey School of Business at Santa Clara University who has painstakingly reconstructed bond market returns back to 1793. He found that bonds in the 19th century performed significantly better than previously estimated.",
            "The table below summarizes what McQuarrie found for 20-year holding periods back to the late 1700s. (Note that he considers that bonds and stocks tie when the difference in their annualized returns is less than half a percentage point.)",

            "Why hasn’t the Federal government’s extraordinary fiscal and monetary stimulus led to higher inflation and bigger increases in gold? Imagine if we were told last February that $5 trillion would be injected into the U.S. economy by May — a $3 trillion increase in the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet and $2 trillion in Congress’ fiscal stimulus (the CARES act). I would have expected both gold prices and inflation expectations to explode.",
            "Yet they instead have reacted with little more than a shrug. According to the Cleveland Federal Reserve, expected inflation annualized over the next 10 years has fallen to 1.16% from 1.62% in February.",
            "And while gold GC00, -0.16% has rallied after initially falling along with the S&P 500 SPX, +0.23% in late February and early March, its price now is almost 3% below its mid-April high — including a 1.5% decline on Thursday of this week alone.",
            "The first factor that helps to explain these otherwise inscrutable reactions is the declining velocity of money — how often money changes hands. That’s because increasing the supply of money, as the federal government has done, will be less stimulating to the extent people are less inclined to use it. ",
            "There’s no doubt that the velocity of money has fallen. In fact, as you can see from the chart below, it has plunged. Part of the reason that the velocity has fallen is that many of us have been sheltering in place and therefore have had fewer opportunities to spend than previously. But we’re also reticent to spend because we’re worried about the future — whether we’ll have a job, whether a crashing stock market will sabotage our retirements, and so on.",
            "So while there is more money sloshing around the economy, we’re less likely to spend it. It therefore shouldn’t be particularly surprising that the additional stimulus hasn’t translated into higher inflation expectations and gold prices.",
            "The other reason the price of gold hasn’t exploded upwards in the wake of the extraordinary government stimulus is excessive bullishness on the part of gold market timers. As contrarian analysis teaches us, markets typically perform better in the wake of skepticism than in the wake of optimism.",
            "Consider the average recommended gold market exposure level among several dozen short-term gold timers I monitor (as measured by the Hulbert Gold Newsletter Sentiment Index, or HGNSI). Since gold’s mid-April high, for example, this average exposure level has risen slightly — to 54.2% from 52.0% — even while the price of gold has dropped more than $40. It’s a telltale sign of stubbornly-held bullishness when exposure levels stay constant, much less rise, in the face of a falling market. And stubbornly-held bullishness is not positive, according to contrarians.",
            "Currently, the HGNSI is higher than it’s been on 81% of trading days since 2000. To illustrate the poor odds that gold faces because of the HGNSI’s high level, I constructed the following table. It contrasts the performance of gold mining stocks in the wake of the 19% of days since 2000 in which the HGNSI was highest, to the returns in the wake of the 19% of days in which the HGNSI was lowest.

            "At age 25, Kevin Guardia has already been investing for nearly half his life. Guardia’s father opened a small brokerage account for his son when Kevin was in junior high, and the young man started to dabble in buying and selling stocks just as the long rebound from the financial crisis got underway.",
            "Now that he’s on his own, Guardia tackles investing more purposefully. “The whole point of buying a stock is the discounted value of future earnings,” he said. “So you want earnings that are going to go up, but you also want earnings that will be good for the future of this world.”",
            "Guardia’s views on what is “good for the future” are eclectic, just like the diverse drivers luring more investors to embrace the “environmental, social and governance,” or ESG, investing category, a segment of the market also sometimes called sustainable, socially responsible or values investing.",
            "Guardia is concerned about pollution and the environment but is also keenly aware of privacy issues. Kevin’s father supports this approach, but “we have different priorities,” with the senior Guardia’s eyes firmly on returns, Kevin told MarketWatch. The question of priorities has long complicated how ESG investing is viewed, with detractors warning that the full potential for profits is almost always sacrificed to do good and proponents saying that’s nothing but a myth.",
            "Investing professionals have long expected the Guardia family dynamic to unfold across financial markets as a younger generation comes of investing age. Millennials and Generation Z may get blamed for “killing” plenty of old traditions, but they’re also seen as having a lot more heart — and awareness — about how their dollars impact the world. And in the immediate aftermath of two financial market shocks — one from the collapse in oil prices CL00, +3.66% and the other from the economic devastation wrought by the COVID-19 pandemic — it’s an impulse that takes on additional weight.",
            "Read:Why don’t we panic about climate change like we do coronavirus?",
            "“We have a lot of evidence that this next generation that’s going to take over the world does care,” said Dave Nadig, chief investment officer and director of research at ETF Database. “They’re asking harder questions. The question now is, what is the right way for them to express those opinions?”",
            "That’s a high-stakes, nearly $21 billion question in fact — the amount of new money pulled into funds identified as “sustainable” in 2019. The figure, tracked by Morningstar, marked a nearly fourfold increase over the previous calendar-year record, set in 2018.",
            "In early 2020, even as COVID-19 ravaged mainstream investments SPX, +0.23%, global demand for ESG proved resilient. In the first quarter of 2020, Morningstar found that the global sustainable-fund universe collected inflows of $45.6 billion, compared with outflows of $384.7 billion for the overall fund universe.",
            "For many ESG investing advocates, the flow data is validation. Americans aren’t just claiming to be interested in sustainable investing; they are putting their money where their mouth is. Forward-looking sentiment surveys are also encouraging for those who support this investing theme.",
            "In its 2020 global exchange-traded-funds investor survey, taken ahead of the full force of the pandemic, Brown Brothers Harriman found that an estimated 74% of global investors plan to increase their ESG exchange-traded-fund allocation over the next year. Almost one in five investors said they would allocate between 21% and 50% of their portfolios to ESG funds in five years. BBH, in its report, concluded that ESG “doesn’t appear to be a passing fad.”",
            "Yet even with the inflows and the optimism, ESG remains a landscape fraught with challenges for all ages, from do-it-yourselfers like Kevin Guardia all the way up the investing food chain to someone like Larry Fink, head of $7 trillion asset manager BlackRock BLK, +0.94%. Fink in January announced his firm’s climate-conscious shift and a prediction that climate change will shape all investing in decades to come.",
            "Off the top, ESG labeling qualifications remain fuzzy; fund-manager intent isn’t always clear; and just how returns might be pumped up, for instance with funds retaining some companies with questionable social responsibility in the mix, eludes even the most open-minded investors.",
            "Values are just as personal in investing as in, say, religion or education. Guardia tries to invest in companies seen as supporting the Hong Kong protesters rather than the Chinese government. Another investor may prioritize investing in companies with diverse boards of directors incorporating more women and people of color on the belief that they will guide that company’s actions in the future, even if its current performance causes other investors to shy away.",
            "There’s a solid chance that if you’ve put some of your own money in a fund marketed as sustainable, you might be surprised and disappointed at the way those ideas are interpreted by the fund manager. That manager may in turn think she has a great “values” idea, but is hamstrung by archaic or inflexible industry customs. There’s plenty of professional piling-on — by financial advisers, wealth-management-product designers and the media, for starters — who don’t really care what “sustainable” technically means, so long as it brings more eyeballs, more dollars and, ultimately, some of the pie for them.",
            "Read: Here’s what you need to know about the $12 trillion ESG investment world",
            "SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce said late last year as the regulator began a review of the sector’s socially responsible promises that “the first issue is that we don’t even know what ESG means,” adding that “defining that would be an important first step before trying to develop metrics.”",
            "Related: SEC cracking down on ‘misleading’ mutual-fund names",
            "Also: Do well by doing good with this fund that supports freedom and human rights",
            "This dynamic was on stark display at an exchange-traded-fund gathering earlier this year. One fund-industry pro suggested the X-Trackers S&P 500 ESG fund SNPE, +0.23% should be considered “ETF of the year.” Another scoffed because prominently displayed among the fund’s top 20 holdings is Exxon Mobil XOM, +0.09%, one of the world’s biggest fossil-fuel concerns, he noted.",
            "Indeed, less than half of the funds — 91 of the 303 sustainable funds tracked by Morningstar — are fossil-fuel-free or even “low carbon” by prospectus. As for thermal-coal exposure, 47 funds have none, and another 26 have less than 1% exposure, but 34 sustainable funds have thermal-coal exposure of between 3% and 5% of assets (thermal coal takes up around 4% of broader global indexes). Three State Street ETFs use the phrase “Fossil Fuel Reserves Free” in their names. They exclude companies that own “proved and probable coal, oil, and/or natural gas reserves used for energy purposes” but still have overall fossil-fuel exposure ranging from 4.3% to 7.4%.",
            "Read more: Oil giant BP is latest to pledge net zero emissions by 2050",
            "Investors sometimes formulate their own definition and timeline, depending on broader market issues. In an article published recently by an ETF trade publication, the massive surge of inflows into the iShares ESG MSCI U.S.A. ETF was described as a response to “cratering oil prices” in early 2020. But there’s nothing especially “ESG” about the fund’s makeup.",
            "The lack of standardization in ESG plays out in other ways. After several years running a hedge fund, Nancy Davis launched a unique ETF in 2019. The Quadratic Interest Rate Volatility and Inflation Hedge ETF IVOL, -0.03% uses options to help manage the interest-rate risk from government bonds. Those securities are inherently oriented to the public good, funding infrastructure, for instance, in a way that rent-seeking corporations aren’t, Davis has argued in making the case that she, too, is an ESG investor of sorts.",
            "She also said that, as a woman-owned firm, her company checks more of the “governance” boxes in the ESG playlist than the massive corporations behind funds like X-Trackers S&P 500 ESG. The SPDR Gender Diversity Index ETF SHE, +0.04% has as a top five holding shares of Wells Fargo & Co. WFC, -1.18%, a poster child for bad governance, some would argue, in the wake of its widely reported customer abuse.",
            "But Davis has had trouble securing for her fund the “ESG” label that helps market these massive concerns.",
            "Another well-worn criticism of ESG is that performance lags. That bears a second look, says Karen Wallace, director of investor education at Morningstar. The fund research firm says its study of over 56 ESG-screened indexes finds that performance across the survey range reveals returns uncompromised by feel-good stock picking.",
            "Why? Companies that care about ESG metrics also tend to care about healthier balance sheets, stronger competitive advantages and lower volatility overall, historically boosting their long-run returns, Wallace said.",
            "Opinion: Critics of ESG funds are wrong — sustainable investing delivers competitive returns",
            "Over the past five years, sustainable funds have done well in both up and down markets relative to their conventional peers, according to Morningstar data. When markets were flat (2015) or down (2018), the returns of 57% and 62% of sustainable funds, respectively, placed them in the top half of their categories. When markets were up in 2016, 2017 and 2019, the returns of 55%, 54% and 67% for sustainable funds placed in the top half of their categories.",
            "A partial explanation for the outperformance of sustainable equity funds over traditional ones lies in their being underweight energy stocks during a period of significant underperformance by that sector, such as in 2019, even before the COVID-linked oil-price crater. Diversified sustainable U.S. equity funds have about a 1.9% average energy weighting, compared with 3.9% for the S&P 500 SPX, +0.23%.",
            "Read: This ETF takes a ‘conscious capitalism’ approach",
            "“ ‘ESG is in many ways the new active investing.’ ”",
            "Importantly, investors are also getting more opportunity for portfolios that “create” good rather than only being able to avoid the “bad.” In other words, ESG investing has evolved over the past 20 years away from a focus on excluding components deemed negative (tobacco or gun stocks) to an integrative approach of building an ESG portfolio, perhaps adding solar stocks or seeking out a company with minority representation on its board.",
            "The “avoidance” ESG approach, still in use by managers who often pledge an alignment with religious values, “excluded prominent companies from the investment universe for nonfinancial reasons, which can lead to underperformance,” said Wallace. The newer approach, she said, “tilts the portfolio toward companies that are better at managing ESG issues and therefore less likely to face financial risks such as fines, lawsuits and reputational damage.” In general, tech stocks increasingly find their way into ESG portfolios.",
            "With more stock-specific selection, “ESG is in many ways the new active investing,” agreed Ethan Powell, a former hedge-fund manager who founded the nonprofit Impact Shares, which was named most innovative in 2019 by ETF.com. That includes how a fund engages with the companies it owns, applies pressure by proxy and seeks to provide measurable impact beyond financial return.",
            "Jackie Liu, co-chair of San Francisco law firm Morrison & Foerster’s global corporate department, also questioned why there’s a lingering underperformance stigma, considering that institutional investors with long-run future returns at stake for trillions in holdings — large pension funds, including CalPERS, among them — have led the conversion to sustainable portfolios. Any investors might look at what drives institutional decision making, she said, which is formulated to be better insulated against climate-change lawsuits, rising insurance costs and other future risks.",
            "Still, caution abounds. Investors would be wise to stop thinking of “Wall Street” as a service industry and start thinking of it as just another product peddler, Ric Edelman counsels. It’s his belief that “ESG” is an au courant way of making investing products sexy enough to distinguish them from the cheapest, commoditized offerings from the likes of Vanguard and BlackRock.",
            "“ ‘[ESG] is great marketing, but a lot of sizzle, no steak.’ ”",
            "Edelman is the founder of Edelman Financial Engines, the largest independent financial advisory firm in the U.S. And he’s not the only high-profile ESG skeptic. “It’s a complete fraud,” the venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya said on CNBC in February. “It’s great marketing, but a lot of sizzle, no steak.”",
            "For his part, Edelman has other, more nuanced, reasons for not steering his clients to ESG strategies: “Applying a noneconomic filter to an economic decision is never a good approach,” he told MarketWatch. And: “Mixing social morals with investments can be as dangerous as mixing politics and investments.”",
            "It’s Edelman suggestion that “morally driven” investors instead make charitable contributions with the returns they receive from traditional investment strategies.",
            "Another increasingly popular approach is likewise an about-face from the traditional divest-from-the-violators concept, and urges investors to fight for change because they have skin in the game. Suz Mac Cormac, corporate partner at Morrison & Foerster, who chairs its energy and social enterprise and impact-investing practices, represents clients who see merit in “fighting from the inside.”",
            "“You can cut them off or you can engage,” she said, by investing in, and thus, holding companies responsible for ESG action via shareholder or employee activism.",
            "Fund giant State Street Global Advisors, for instance, this year put the companies it invests in on behalf of clients on notice, saying three out of four companies aren’t meeting ESG targets and will be subjected to proxy voting action against board members and other steps.",
            "Read:JPMorgan Chase shareholders defeat call for greater climate-change disclosure at world’s largest oil funder",
            "Finally, there’s another strategy that has its roots in the attempt to express social values through portfolios, but will likely soon overtake investing of all types: “direct indexing.”",
            "Natalie Truty, an adviser at New York–based Wealthspire, is a veteran of what she calls “the values-based discussion.” Once she understands exactly what a client wants — sometimes the mandate can be as vague as “make me more sustainable” — Truty can essentially build, on the client’s behalf, a portfolio that reflects those impulses.",
            "Truty describes direct indexing like this: “It’s as if you took an index fund and unwrapped it.” She can apply the client’s “screens” -— such as avoiding tobacco or guns — to narrow down, say, the S&P 500 SPX, +0.23% to the Smith Family 400.",
            "Truty said she’ll be watching with interest to see if the socioeconomic issues that battered financial markets in March and April will filter into client decisions. When the global oil-price war — what many analysts believe may be the death rattle for fossil-fuel dominance — broke out, Truty fielded several calls from clients seeking reassurance that they had no exposure to oil.",
            "For now, that kind of high-touch service, including responding to all those increasingly plugged-in ESG investors, is only available to clients with enough assets to make it worthwhile for most advisers. But just like any revolutionary technology — ETF Database’s Dave Nadig calls direct indexing “the self-driving cars of investment management” — the software is likely to become more inexpensive and widespread.",
            "“I’m an outlier on this, but I believe that in 10 years, wrappers like ETFs and mutual funds are going to seem archaic,” Nadig told MarketWatch. “They’re great for pooling people’s money together. But the minute you have a personal opinion, wrappers stink.”"

            "WASHINGTON (AP) — Reconsideration of jobless aid is fast becoming the focus of congressional debate over the next virus aid package",
            "Republicans are staking out plans to phase out coronavirus-related unemployment benefits to encourage Americans to go back to work, although it’s not clear when there will be jobs to return to.",
            "“Republicans and the White House are reaching consensus on the need for redesigning the unemployment benefits so they are not a barrier to getting people back to work,” Rep. Kevin Brady of Texas, the top Republican on the House Ways and Means Committee, told reporters on a conference call.",
            "President Donald Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell huddled at the White House to discuss the issues.",
            "The flurry of activity comes after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ushered a new $3 trillion aid package through the House last week, amid opposition from moderate Democrats. The Senate, under McConnell, says there is no urgency to act, and senators are expected to reconsider more aid only in June.",
            "Ohio Democrat Sherrod Brown voiced outrage that McConnell kept the Senate in session for three weeks before Thursday’s recess, requiring legislative staff, Capitol police and cafeteria and custodial workers and others to report for work, contrary to public health guidance, as he and his fellow Republicans pursued their own Senate priorities, notably the confirmation of Trump nominees, and not the needs of American families and communities facing public health and economic crises.",
            "With the nation’s death toll poised to hit 100,000 this weekend and layoffs surpassing 38 million, some lawmakers see a failure by Washington to act as untenable. Yet Congress has moved beyond the political consensus reached at the outset of the crisis and is now splitting along familiar party lines.",
            "The difference in approach and priorities between Democrats and Republicans reflects the partisan split that is defining both parties before the 2020 election.",
            "At least one Republican, Sen. Cory Gardner of Colorado, urged the Senate not to recess unless it considered more aid. “Now is not the time for the Senate to go home,” tweeted Gardner, who is among the most politically endangered GOP senators running for re-election in the fall.",
            "But senators nonetheless left town for a Memorial Day recess slated to last through next week.",
            "Gardner wanted agreement to extend the small business Paycheck Protection Program and pushed for more funds for state and local governments facing layoffs. He told reporters he had called Trump to express his concerns.",
            "As a result, senators were trying to fast-track a proposal to extend the Paycheck Protection Program’s expiration. The proposed fix would double from eight to 16 weeks the window for business owners absorbing losses because of the COVID-19 pandemic to spend their federally backed loans and still qualify to have them forgiven. The program was established in March under an earlier coronavirus response bill.",
            "While the House works remotely, the lights-on Senate has the legislative stage to itself. But the chamber that considers itself the world’s greatest deliberative body spent May debating almost anything but the pandemic. It confirmed several of Trump’s executive and judicial nominees, including John Ratcliffe on Thursday as director of national intelligence.",
            "“You wouldn’t even know there’s a COVID crisis,” Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York told ABC’s “The View.” “Crazy. It’s just so wrong.”",
            "See:Democrats remain skeptical that Ratcliffe will operate independently as Texas Republican wins confirmation as intelligence chief",
            "McConnell argued that his side of the Capitol led passage of the earlier $2 trillion package. Better to assess how that money is being spent, he said, before approving more. He rejected the new $3 trillion package approved by the Democratic-led House last week as a “liberal wish list,” a phrase that has emerged as a Republican talking point over the past weeks.",
            "On Thursday, McConnell mocked the House for working remotely and voting by proxy while senators in masks show up like other Americans returning to work. The District of Columbia has been under stay-at-home orders, but Mayor Muriel Bowser said Thursday the numbers are pointing to the start of a gradual reopening process at the end of May.",
            "“The self-described ‘People’s House’ has been suspiciously empty of people,” McConnell said. “Every one of my Senate colleagues should be proud of how we’ve helped our nation win this first battle.”",
            "Pelosi shot back: “We have the Heroes bill,” she said about the House-passed aid measure. “He has the zeroes bill.”",
            "McConnell questioned whether votes the House has recorded remotely are constitutional.",
            "Unemployment insurance, though, was quickly becoming a new priority for Republicans staking out the next aid package.",
            "Brady warned that generous benefits, with a $600 weekly boost during the pandemic approved under the earlier aid bill, would “handcuff” workers and discourage them from returning to work.",
            "Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., said, “It was a mistake to make it so high to begin with. It would be a mistake to extend it.”",
            "Republicans are hopeful that as states reopen, the economy will improve, lessening the need for more federal funds. But if workers refuse to return to work, they worry companies can’t begin to rebound.",
            "Brady has proposed giving workers a one-time $1,200 bonus to get back to work. He said conversations were happening at the highest levels.",
            "But polling shows Americans are concerned about a second wave of the virus as shops and workplaces reopen. A poll by the Associated Press–NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found 83% of Americans are at least somewhat concerned that lifting restrictions in their area will lead to additional infections, with 54% saying they are very or extremely concerned."

            "WASHINGTON (AP) — Congressional Democrats are protesting President Donald Trump’s decision to remove the Transportation Department’s acting inspector general, the latest in a string of actions by Trump to fire or replace government watchdogs.",
            "The Democratic chairs of three House panels demanded this week that Mitch Behm be reinstated immediately as acting inspector general.",
            "The lawmakers also demanded that the Trump administration turn over information about current investigations that might have played a role in Behm’s removal, including a review of whether Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao has given preferential treatment to Kentucky. Her husband, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican and a top Trump ally, is seeking re-election this year.",
            "Behm’s removal “is the latest in a series of politically motivated firings of inspectors general by President Trump,’’ the lawmakers wrote. “This assault on the integrity and independence of inspectors general appears to be an intentional campaign to undermine their ability to expose corruption and protect taxpayer dollars from waste, fraud and abuse.”",
            "Behm’s removal from the inspector-general post appeared to come on the same Friday night that Steve Linick, the inspector general of the State Department, was fired, but it wasn’t till Tuesday that the ethics watchdog group CREW brought it to light.",
            "See:Pompeo confirms he asked Trump to fire State Department inspector general but insists it wasn’t to sideline probe into his conduct",
            "The letter was signed by Rep. Peter DeFazio of Oregon, chairman of the House Transportation Committee; Oversight Committee Chair Carolyn Maloney of New York; and Virginia Rep. Gerald Connolly, who leads an Oversight subcommittee.",
            "A spokesman for Chao said Behm was not fired and continues to serve as deputy inspector general. Howard Elliott, administrator of the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, is replacing Behm while continuing to lead the pipeline agency.",
            "“Mr. Elliott will bring decades of valuable expertise to the role of acting inspector general, both in safety and in law enforcement,’’ the spokesman said, noting that Elliott came out of retirement to lead the pipeline agency after serving as safety chief for CSX Transportation, a large freight rail company.",
            "The removals of Linick and Behm are part of a pattern of Trump taking aim at inspectors general.",
            "In April, he fired Michael Atkinson, the inspector general for the intelligence community, for his role in the whistleblower complaint that led to Trump’s impeachment.",
            "See:Ousted intelligence inspector general says Trump fired him for doing his job",
            "Then Trump removed Glenn Fine as acting inspector general at the Defense Department. The move stripped him of his post as chairman of the Pandemic Response Accountability Committee, one of several watchdog groups overseeing the vast economic relief law passed by Congress in response to the coronavirus crisis.",
            "Trump also has moved to replace an inspector general of the Department of Health and Human Services who wrote a report that found hospitals faced severe shortages of coronavirus tests and supplies. Trump questioned the veracity of the report and the independence of the HHS official, Christi Grimm, a career employee who has served as acting inspector general since January. Trump has nominated a permanent replacement, an appointment that requires Senate confirmation.",
            "Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, called Trump’s firings of Linick and other officials a “threat to accountable democracy.”",
            "“The firings of multiple Inspectors General is unprecedented; doing so without good cause chills the independence essential to their purpose. It is a threat to accountable democracy and a fissure in the constitutional balance of power,” Romney tweeted Saturday.",
            "Romney is the only Senate Republican who voted to convict Trump of abuse of power in his impeachment trial earlier this year. Trump responded to Romney’s tweet by calling him a “LOSER” on Twitter.",
            "Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, has called for the White House to explain the dismissals of Linick and Atkinson, the intelligence community watchdog.",
            "Grassley, a Trump ally, said Congress intended that inspectors general only be removed when there is clear evidence of unfitness, wrongdoing or failure to perform the duties of the office. “An expression of lost confidence, without further explanation, is not sufficient,” he said.",
            "Grassley reiterated on Friday that he was still seeking answers about the inspector-general removals, giving the White House a Tuesday deadline:",
            "Trump has designated Howard Elliott, head of a Transportation Department agency that oversees pipeline safety, to replace Behm as acting inspector general. Elliott will keep his job at the pipeline agency, reporting to Chao, which the three House Democrats said was a conflict of interest.",
            "The DOT spokesman said officials expect Elliott to recuse himself from audits or investigations of the pipeline agency.",
            "Still, the lawmakers asked for information regarding ongoing audits, inspections, investigations, evaluations, reviews and other communications regarding Behm’s removal and Elliott’s qualifications to be inspector general. Any attempt by Chao or her office to interfere with an inspector general’s investigation “is illegal and will be thoroughly examined by our committees,” they wrote.",
            "The department, according to a Washington Post report, said Thursday that there had been no nefarious motive at play in Behm’s removal."

            "RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) — The coronavirus pandemic accelerated across Latin America on Friday, bringing a surge of new infections and deaths, even as curves flattened and reopening was underway in much of Europe, Asia and the United States.",
            "“ Brazil’s president, Jair Bolsonaro, has scoffed at the seriousness of the virus and actively campaigned against state governors’ attempts to impose limits on citizens’ movements and commerce, firing his first health minister for siding with governors’ stay-at-home recommendations and restrictions on activity. ”",
            "Coronavirus update: U.S. death toll approaches 100,000 as CDC’s testing practices are criticized by health experts",
            "The region’s two largest nations — Mexico and Brazil — reported record counts of new cases and deaths almost daily this week, fueling criticism of their presidents, who have slow-walked shutdowns in attempts to limit economic damage.",
            "Brazil reported 310,087 cases and 20,047 deaths, making it the third worst-hit country in the world by official counts. Experts consider both numbers undercounts due to the widespread lack of testing.",
            "The virus “does not forgive. It does not choose race or if you are rich or poor, black or white. It’s a cruel disease,” Bruno Almeida de Mello, a 24-year-old Uber UBER, +1.66% driver, said at his 66-year-old grandmother’s burial in Rio de Janeiro.",
            "Infections rose and intensive-care units were also swamped in Peru, Chile and Ecuador, countries lauded for imposing early and aggressive business shutdowns and quarantines. Many experts said the rising death toll across Latin America showed the limits of government action in a region where millions labor in informal jobs and many police forces are weak or corrupt and unable to enforce restrictions.",
            "Many governments — even those where the virus is still on the rise — say they must shift their focus to saving jobs that are vanishing as quickly as the disease can spread. In the United States and China, the world’s two largest economies, unemployment is soaring.",
            "The Federal Reserve chairman has estimated that as many as one in four Americans could be jobless, while in China analysts estimate around a third of the urban workforce is unemployed.",
            "Meanwhile, the virus is roaring through countries ill-equipped to handle the pandemic, which many scientists fear will seed the embers of a second global wave of infections.",
            "India saw its biggest single-day spike since the pandemic began, and Pakistan and Russia recorded their highest death tolls. Most new Indian cases are in Bihar, where thousands returned home from jobs in the cities. For over a month, some walked among crowds for hundreds of miles.",
            "Back in Brazil, Vandelma Rosa had all the virus’s symptoms, but her death certificate reads “suspected of COVID-19,” according to her grandson, because the hospital lacked tests to confirm. That means her passing did not figure into the death toll, which marked its biggest single-day increase Thursday: 1,181.",
            "President Jair Bolsonaro has scoffed at the seriousness of the virus and actively campaigned against state governors’ attempts to impose limits on citizens’ movements and commerce.",
            "Bolsonaro fired his first health minister for siding against him in backing governors’ stay-at-home recommendations and restrictions on activity. His second minister resigned about a month later after openly disagreeing with Bolsonaro about chloroquine, the predecessor of the anti-malarial often touted by U.S. President Donald Trump as a viable coronavirus treatment.",
            "“In Rio de Janeiro, you see people going out normally, without a mask, in some neighborhoods. They aren’t believing in this disease. And it’s sad that in other countries people believe, but not here,” de Mello said. “You need to lose someone in your family to be able to believe.”",
            "On Thursday, opposition lawmakers and other detractors protested in front of Congress in the capital, Brasilia. They called for Bolsonaro’s impeachment, alleging criminal mishandling of virus response. Two of them displayed a Brazilian flag, defaced with hundreds of tiny black crosses to represent the dead.",
            "“ President Andrés Manuel López Obrador of Mexico downplayed the threat the virus posed for weeks and argued that Mexicans’ strong family bonds and work ethic would pull them through. It passed 6,000 confirmed deaths on Wednesday. ”",
            "Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador downplayed the threat the virus posed for weeks as he continued to travel the country after Mexico’s first confirmed case. He let his health advisers take the lead on the crisis, but continued insisting that Mexico was different, that its strong family bonds and work ethic would pull it through.",
            "Mexico passed 6,000 confirmed deaths on Wednesday. The country has recently reported more than 400 deaths a day, and new infections still have not peaked. Many deaths categorized as “atypical pneumonia” are suspected of being COVID-19 but not included in the official count. The true count may be several times higher.",
            "Armando Sepulveda, manager of San Cristobal Mauseleum in the massive Mexico City suburb of Ecatepec, said his burial and cremation business has doubled in recent weeks.",
            "“The crematoriums are saturated,” Sepulveda said Thursday. “All of the ovens don’t have that capacity.” Families scour the city looking for funeral services that can handle their dead “in desperation,” because the hospitals cannot hold the dead for long, he said.",
            "The Mexican government has shifted its attention to reactivating the economy.",
            "Mining, construction and parts of the North American automotive supply chain were allowed to resume operations this week, but analysts predict a massive economic contraction in an economy that had already entered a technical recession before the pandemic.",
            "The pandemic reaches from Latin America’s mega-cities deep into the Amazon jungle.",
            "The Colombian town of Leticia, which lies along the Amazon River at the border of Brazil and Peru, has nearly 1,300 cases. Residents are reeling from both the illness and a sudden loss of income, much of which came from tourism. Families have begun placing red cloth flags outside humble homes with tin roofs to show they are going hungry.",
            "Authorities in Colombia have pointed a finger at Brazil to explain the sudden rise in infections there, and President Iván Duque has imposed strict measures aimed at keeping cases out, including militarizing the border. But with many informal crossing points, it is nearly impossible to completely seal Colombia off.",
            "In Chile, more than 90% of intensive-care beds were full last week in the capital, Santiago, where the main cemetery dug 1,000 emergency graves to prepare for a wave of deaths despite a strict, early quarantine. Ecuador’s government declared a 2 p.m.–to–5 a.m. curfew in March, among other measures, but cases have swamped medical and mortuary services in the city of Guayaquil and, now, in the capital, Quito.",
            "Hundreds of people can be seen violating the curfew daily in Ecuadorian cities, many selling goods on the streets to earn enough to buy food.",
            "Other rule-breakers aren’t needy. A doctor treating coronavirus in a hospital in northern Quito said he had treated members of a family who threw a Mother’s Day barbeque despite the restrictions. The family’s mother and her brother died of coronavirus, and seven relatives are hospitalized. The doctor spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to the press.",
            "Peru has 2.5 intensive-care beds per 100,000 people, one quarter of the global standard. With almost 109,000 confirmed cases and more than 3,100 dead as of Thursday night, Peruvian media showed images of patients slumped in wheelchairs receiving oxygen. Doctors say most patients are shopkeepers, taxi drivers or street vendors."

            "WASHINGTON (AP) — The Senate on Thursday confirmed Texas Rep. John Ratcliffe as director of national intelligence, installing a new head of the nation’s intelligence agencies at a time when President Donald Trump has ousted multiple officials.",
            "Ratcliffe seemed unlikely to get the position when he was nominated in February, as he had already been nominated for the job last year and then withdrew after Republicans questioned his experience. But senators warmed to him as they grew concerned about upheaval in the intelligence community under Trump and wanted a permanent, confirmed director.",
            "“ Ratcliffe was the first DNI nominee not to win broad bipartisan support since the position was created in 2005. ”",
            "The Texas Republican will replace Richard Grenell, the current acting director who has overseen many of the personnel changes. The last Senate-confirmed director, former Indiana Sen. Dan Coats, left the post last summer after clashing with Trump.",
            "Democrats allowed a quick vote on the nomination this week, dispensing with any procedural delays in a signal that they prefer Ratcliffe over Grenell. But most Democrats still opposed his nomination, making Ratcliffe the first DNI not to win broad bipartisan support since the position was created in 2005. The vote was 49-44.",
            "See:Senate Republicans in no rush to take up further coronavirus aid as chamber heads toward recess Thursday",
            "Democrats said they were skeptical that Ratcliffe would be an independent leader, despite his assurances during his confirmation hearing. The Republican has been an ardent defender of the president through House impeachment and investigations into Russian interference.",
            "Ratcliffe worked to separate himself from the president at his confirmation hearing, including by saying he believed Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election, a conclusion Trump has resisted. He said he would communicate to Trump the intelligence community’s findings even if he knew Trump disagreed with them and might fire him.",
            "Still, the position carries unique challenges given the president’s seeming inclinations to politicize intelligence and to bend intelligence agencies to his will. Trump has openly rejected intelligence community assessments at odds with his own viewpoint, including on the Russian interference.",
            "Trump has also shown himself as eager to have intelligence agencies investigate matters that he hopes will support his political positions, with agencies now trying to determine whether the coronavirus pandemic emerged in a laboratory in China or from a market.",
            "In addition, the DNI is encountering ongoing political pressure, including from Republicans in Congress, to declassify and make public information from the Russia investigation that Trump allies hope will cast senior Obama administration officials — including former vice president and 2020 opponent Joe Biden — in a negative light.",
            "Last week, for instance, Senate Republicans released a newly declassified list of former intelligence officials who requested the identity of an American from intelligence reports who turned out to be former Trump administration national security adviser Michael Flynn. On Tuesday, Republicans released a January 2017 memo that Susan Rice, President Barack Obama’s national security adviser, wrote to herself documenting a sensitive conversation about Flynn and his Russian contacts that she participated in earlier in the month with Obama and then-FBI Director James Comey.",
            "And there have been calls from Democrats, and Flynn’s own lawyer, to release declassified transcripts of intercepted phone calls during the presidential transition period between Flynn and then–Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about those communications, though the Justice Department has since moved to dismiss the case. Demands to make that information public could confront Ratcliffe in his new role.",
            "“No lawyer for Flynn has ever seen it or heard the recording” of the call, Flynn’s lawyer, Sidney Powell, said in an email to The Associated Press. “ I would want both.”",

And why is antibody testing being lumped into the same category as molecular testing?",
            "When tests return high positivity rates, it often means that cases are being missed. The World Health Organization has said one positive case per 10 negative tests is a good indicator that there is enough testing under way. The U.S. positivity rate, as of March 9, was 15.7%.",
            "The other issue is that there is little real-world use for antibody test results at this point in the pandemic; it remains to be seen whether antibodies provide immunity to the virus, now or in the future. The American Medical Association, the largest group of physicians in the U.S., said recently that serologic tests should only be used for research and deciding which patients can donate plasma, and not as a determination of immunity or a reason to lessen social-distancing practices.",
            "The Harvard Global Health Institute has called for the U.S. to conduct 900,000 tests daily by May 15. Another Harvard University organization, the Edmond J. Safra Center for Ethics, has said five million COVID-19 tests need to be conducted a day by early June.",

            "The U.S. testing response has faced multiple problems since the first coronavirus case was identified in January. The CDC-developed test to detect a COVID-19 infection was initially faulty, which required states to send samples back to the CDC for confirmatory testing, a process that slowed down the diagnosis of new infections. There largely haven’t been enough tests, including for health care workers. By mid-March, the number of molecular tests in the U.S. paled in comparison to those done in countries like South Korea. As of March 17, the U.S. had conducted 25,162 tests, while South Korea had tested more than 260,000 people.",

During the week of May 3, the most recent data available from CDC, the U.S. conducted nearly 1 million diagnostic tests.",

            "The leaders of this swing state are swinging back at the president.",
            "Trump has been butting heads with Michigan leaders — namely the governor, the secretary of state and the attorney general, who are all female Democrats — which came to a head when the commander-in-chief visited a Detroit-area Ford F, +0.35% plant on Thursday, and only wore a state-mandated face mask for part of the tour.",
            "Attorney General Dana Nessel had written an open letter to the president earlier in the week noting that he had “a legal responsibility” to wear a face covering while visiting the Ypsilanti facility, as the social distancing guidance is not only a Ford company policy, but also a state law. Nessel also called it “a social and moral responsibility” for the POTUS to help prevent spreading the virus in a state that has seen more than 53,000 cases and 5,000 deaths from COVID-19.",
            "Trump did not wear a mask for the photographed portion of the tour because “I didn’t want to give the press the pleasure of seeing it,” he said on Thursday. Ford confirmed that the president had been encouraged by company chairman Bill Ford Jr. to wear a mask for his visit to the plant, and had worn it for a portion of his tour before removing it. Ford’s CEO, Jim Hackett, told reporters that, “It’s up to him” on whether to wear one or not.",
            "Read more:Trump says he wore a mask at Ford plant — but ‘didn’t want to give the press the pleasure of seeing it’",
            "Some images of Trump wearing a face mask with the presidential seal on it were leaked to the Detroit Free Press, however, and were being shared on social media by outlets like TMZ on Friday.",
            "In response to Trump’s partial mask compliance, Nessel told CNN that “The president’s like a petulant child who refuses to follow the rules,” and said he is no longer welcome in the state of Michigan.",
            "She also warned that she planned to have a “very serious conversation” with Ford for bending the rules for the president. And this led Trump to come to Ford’s defense on Twitter TWTR, +0.86% late Thursday night, calling out “The Wacky Do Nothing Attorney General of Michigan” for “viciously threatening” the auto maker in a series of tweets.",
            "He also claimed that automobile companies were leaving the state until he “came along,” and suggested that they might do so again if Nessel punishes Ford.",
            "So Nessel then responded to that by remarking that the state’s auto industry has been “thriving” on its own, and suggested that the president really has a problem with Michigan’s three female leaders. This harks back to when he referred to Gov. Gretchen Whitmer as “the woman in Michigan” during a Coronavirus Task Force briefing in March, when he asked Vice President Mike Pence not to call governors he said hadn’t been “appreciative” enough of his efforts on coronavirus help.",
            "“Don’t call the woman in Michigan,” he said.",
            "Earlier this week, Trump also threatened to pull federal funding from Michigan and Nevada after erroneously tweeting that they were mailing out absentee ballots, which he said was illegal. He also called out Michigan’s “rogue secretary of state,” who had sent the forms out “without authorization.” In fact, the states had actually sent out absentee ballot applications to registered voters. And Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson tweeted at the president that this is well within her authority, and that “Every Michigan registered voter has a right to vote by mail.”",
            "Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak called Trump’s threat “outrageous” over a pair of tweets. The president later corrected his tweet to refer to absentee ballot “applications.”",
            "Read more:Trump threatens Michigan, Nevada over mail-in voting",
            "“Trump is now 3 for 3 at making false accusations about Michigan’s strong female leaders over Twitter,” read a tweet from the Michigan attorney general’s official social media account Friday. “At least he actually managed to remember Dana’s name,” it added, noting Nessel will “continue to stand up to the commander-in-tweet on our behalf.”",
            "Gov. Whitmer also weighed in on the back-and-forth on Friday morning, tweeting her support for Nessel and Benson and saying “how proud I am to serve our state with them.”"

            "The courtship between Aurora Cannabis Inc. and Reliva began, as many such romances do, at a gathering of industry bigwigs and bankers.",
            "It was not quite love at first sight.",
            "Well ahead of the first meeting at a 2019 conference run by an investment bank, Aurora ACB, -7.98% ACB, +2.13% had been shopping for a way to enter the U.S. market for some time, saying so publicly on earnings calls and in interviews with MarketWatch. But it took Aurora months to seriously vet Reliva as an acquisition target, the chief executives at both companies told MarketWatch in a telephone interview this week.",
            "Months after that first meeting, Aurora’s executive team flew to Boston and met with Reliva, a company that specializes in cannabidiol, or CBD. For 48 hours, bosses from Aurora and Reliva visited wholesale and bricks-and-mortar stores and talked about the business, with Aurora interim CEO Michael Singer telling MarketWatch they learned enough in those two days to begin seriously evaluating Reliva.",
            "More on the deal: Aurora Cannabis makes long-awaited push into U.S. with Reliva acquisition",
            "“We learned a lot about Miguel [Martin] and a lot about the Reliva story, and he got to learn about the Aurora corporate story,” Singer said in a telephone interview. “When we think about [Aurora’s] reset plan, we think this was a responsible and strategic acquisition. It’s not just about the U.S.”",
            "Aurora’s lawyers worked furiously to vet Reliva, checking out its operations, staff and intellectual property, though Singer says there was not much IP to consider. Reliva CEO Miguel Martin and other top staff visited Aurora’s board in Toronto — at a time when that was still possible — and several “long and thoughtful conversations” occurred before both sides became comfortable enough to wed, Singer said.",
            "Closely held Reliva had already been trying to attract capital: it had been out looking for cash at $40 million pre-money valuation from venture capitalists, among others, according to two people familiar with the matter. That would be roughly three times Reliva’s annual revenue of $13 million to $14 million, Aurora confirmed Friday.",
            "Instead, Reliva accepted $40 million in Aurora stock to sell the company outright, with another $45 million in potential earn-outs, as the companies announced Wednesday. When Aurora announced the deal, its largely retail investor base reacted positively, bidding up the price of Aurora stock after shares had already posted two days of 50% gains in response to its earnings report.",

            "If successful, the acquisition will help Aurora establish a beachhead in the U.S. via a CBD asset and help to grow its partnership with Ultimate Fighting Championship, which is owned by a number of closely held venture-capital firms. But analysts are not portraying the deal as a no-doubt home run. Jefferies lowered its price target on Aurora stock to C$12 ($9.99) from C$14, to take into account estimates for Reliva.",
            "In a note to clients Friday, Jefferies analyst Owen Bennett wrote that the deal’s timing and this particular acquisition is odd and the company’s focus on adjusted profits warrants a “close look.” In the news release announcing the deal, Aurora touted Reliva as “profitable,” but Singer told MarketWatch it meant on an adjusted basis, not using standard accounting.",
            "“There is still no permanent CEO to lead this CBD push, the CBD space is experiencing significant headwinds currently, there is further dilution at a questionable multiple which has been a criticism of the past,” Bennett wrote. “Further, it potentially clouds the true underlying [earnings before interest taxes deductions amortization] delivery in [the first quarter] which could now be propped up by this deal.”",
            "Reliva operates in a crowded market — there are likely hundreds of companies in the U.S. making cannabidiol, or CBD products — that is difficult to stand out in. While Aurora cited a report predicting the “CBD opportunity” to be $24 billion, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has not issued clear guidance on the substance. Cannabis with tiny amounts of THC, called hemp, was legalized by the U.S. congress in late 2018, but the FDA has made clear that it is illegal to make food, drinks and cosmetic products with CBD as it figures out how to regulate the compound.",
            "Aurora Cannabis on CEO search during a pandemic: drone tours, no handshakes",
            "Martin says that while the FDA’s stance is important, he’s equally focused on state legalization — 41 have passed laws around CBD, which is a nonintoxicating compound found in the marijuana plant.",
            "Reliva makes CBD products, but its true strength lies in its distribution network. Martin says that there are about 50,000 stores that sell CBD in the U.S. at the moment, and his company is selling products in 20,000 of them. And when Martin talks about stores, he’s referring to convenience stores like Circle K, which is owned by Alimentation Couche-Tard Inc. ATD.A, +0.40% ATD.B, -0.02% , a multinational operator of convenience stores based in Laval, Quebec.",
            "Martin says the company’s main pitch for its products is that they are cheap: they’re all under $20, while rival Lord Jones, which was acquired by Cronos Group Inc. CRON, +8.06% CRON, +4.18%, sells 30 gel capsules for $95.",
            "Price could be key amid the COVID-19 pandemic, with Martin noting that disposable incomes are down. It could also hurt the business overall, though, as Martin admitted that the pandemic has impacted sales with a serious decline in foot traffic at convenience stores.",
            "Martin said products have remained for sale, but the impact is unclear for the busy season — that’s May to September for the sorts of retailers on which Reliva relies. The summer months tend to be more lucrative quite simply because the weather is better.",
            "“We have a seasonal business,” Martin said in a telephone interview.",

            "Nvidia Corp., long known as a graphics-chip maker for videogaming, is turning into more of a data-center company.",
            "Nvidia reported strong first-quarter earnings Thursday, as sales of data-center chips soared 80% and surpassed $1 billion in a single quarter for the first time, at $1.13 billion, while gaming chips surged 27% to $1.33 billion. As part of the report, Nvidia also began to report its business segments in a new manner, with segments for computing and graphics, setting up a side-by-side rivalry for the two core areas.",
            "While the segment change — going from a split between Nvidia’s GPU business and its Tegra processor business to differentiating between the uses of the chips Nvidia sells — may seem minor, it is a sign that Nvidia sees these two uses of its chips as equally important.",
            "“It was time to come up with a new view that would take us into the future,” Nvidia Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress said in an interview with MarketWatch on Thursday.",
            "The graphics segment will include graphics chips for gaming, PCs and its game-streaming service and infrastructure, as well as some other businesses, and totaled $1.9 billion in Thursday’s report. The up-and-coming compute segment totaled $1.17 billion in revenue, with growth of 69%, and includes data-center platforms, high-performance computing, and chips and software for autonomous vehicles and robotics.",
            "Both of the core businesses benefited from the move to working from home while sheltering in place during the global pandemic. In addition, starting next quarter, its data-center business will include revenue from the company’s $6.9 billion acquisition of Mellanox, a high-performance computing chip maker it has partnered with recently on two of the world’s fastest supercomputers.",
            "Opinion: Mellanox makes Nvidia a power broker for the next wave of data-center tech",
            "Nvidia NVDA, +2.86% co-founder and Chief Executive Jensen Huang told analysts on the company’s earnings conference call that graphics chips are now seen as a core component in server architecture.",
            "“The notion of accelerating deep learning and machine learning using our GPUs is now common sense,” Huang said. “It didn’t used to be. People still saw it as something esoteric, but today data centers all over the world expect a very significant part of their data center being accelerated with GPUs.”",
            "Indeed, the future for Nvidia right now is continued growth in the data center, and making workloads, such as AI, faster in that environment. Nvidia demonstrated it is in a good spot during the pandemic, with the exception of its automotive business, which fell 7% in the quarter and is expected to worsen to a 40% tumble in the current quarter as the demand for cars has slumped and research in autonomous vehicles has stalled, at least for now.",
            "Business in the Age of COVID-19: Nvidia should dodge massive coronavirus effects thanks to data centers and videogames",
            "“It’s not going to remain that way. It’s going to come back,” Huang said. “And nobody knows what level it’s going to come back to and how long, but it’s going to come back. The automotive industry, they’re hunkered down right now but they will absolutely invest in the future of autonomous vehicles. They have to. Or they’ll be extinct.”",
            "While its automotive business is largely an afterthought now, CFO Kress believes that the gaming and data center are in a “race” to see which one becomes the biggest business segment for Nvidia, showing how far its data-center business has come, against the gaming core that made the company a Silicon Valley powerhouse.",
            "When asked if compute could eventually outpace and overtake gaming, she declined to comment.",
            "“When we do reach that point, you guys will be the first to know,” Kress said. “The great thing about multiple views of these segments is they have very significant TAMs [total addressable markets]. We will see as they race to grow.”",
            "Ever since Nvidia made its machine-learning breakthrough, it has been three companies — a solid, dependable gaming-chip maker, a growing but still young force in data-center chips, and a potential game-changing automotive supplier. With the auto business now farther away from its promise and the data-center business becoming a new core business, Nvidia has rounded into a different beast, and a powerful one."

            "Dr. Deborah Birx, coordinator of the White House coronavirus task force, said Friday that people can enjoy the outdoors if they stay at least 6 feet (2 meters) apart. Birx suggested playing tennis with marked balls, one for each player to handle, or not touching flags on the golf course.",
            "“That is your space, and that’s the space that you need to protect and ensure that you’re social distanced for others,” Birx said at a White House briefing. She also suggested disposable utensils for picnics and potlucks.",

            "The holiday, which honors fallen service members, arrives amid the bleakest economy in decades. Tens of millions have been laid off since the virus hit hard in March and forced shutdowns. Unemployment has reached its highest level since the Great Depression. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warned Thursday that prospects for a recovery will remain unclear until the health crisis is resolved.",
            "Many Memorial Day commemorations have been canceled or downsized, including concerts and fireworks shows. Parks, beaches, campgrounds and swimming pools remain closed in much of the country.",

            "Californians headed into the weekend with both excitement and anxiety after restrictions eased in many areas. The nation’s most populous state has started seeing a decline in COVID-19 hospitalizations after being the first to order a statewide shutdown.",

            "“We’re expecting a bottleneck at some of the popular trails,” spokesman Colton Whitworth said, “especially the lower-elevation ones closer to Seattle.”",
            "At an outdoor beach restaurant in San Diego on Friday, a server wearing surgical gloves and a face covering rushed by with a piña colada in a pineapple-shaped cup. Another employee stood by with cleaning supplies in a gloved hand, ready to sanitize empty tables.",
            "Customer George Cruz could only imagine what crowds may come over the weekend, when he, his wife and 6-year-old daughter will be staying home.",

            "The changing face of major tech conferences came in the form of a live-streamed speech on my computer screen Tuesday morning.",
            "In it, Microsoft Corp. MSFT, +0.04% Chief Executive Satya Nadella laid out his vision for “empowering every developer.” His 20-minute speech was followed by a series of live and prerecorded tutorials on coding, cloud computing, and other geeky topics from TV-like studios on the Microsoft campus, buttressed by slick graphics and pretaped videos, all day and night. And all of it was free, with easy access to 509 sessions and documentation. The two-day conference had the look and feel of content-on-demand a la Netflix Inc. NFLX, -1.58%",
            "A week earlier, Nvidia Corp. NVDA, +2.86% Chief Executive Jensen Huang delivered a two-hour keynote at GTC Digital in nine 12-minute slices, based on topics ranging from autonomous vehicles to artificial intelligence. The presentation, taped in Huang’s kitchen, attracted 4 million views. This year, 57,000 developers signed up to attend; last year, 10,000 physically attended the conference in San Jose, Calif.",
            "Such is the new world of tech conferences in the age of COVID-19. They’ve gone all-digital, like Build and GTC Digital, and may never be the same. Absent a vaccine, the days of thousands of people herded into hotel ballrooms and convention centers like cattle, sharing cabs and eating in cramped quarters, are gone.",
            "Far from crippling the tech industry, however, virtual shows could lead to democratization of what had once been an exclusive, pricey privilege for tech movers and shakers. In the new climate, consumers have free access to valuable technical content whenever they wish to view it.",
            "“This will definitely change the approach of tech conferences. Virtually, you can identify attendees online and track what they see,” Paddy Cosgrave, chief executive of the company that runs the Web Summit and Collision conferences, told MarketWatch in a phone interview Monday. The show, originally planned June 22-25 in Toronto, will go on as an all-digital event those days.",
            "“If the show is pure content and not networking, like an F8 or Build, you can upsell to them virtually,” he said. “F8, AWS, and Build are like infomercials, selling to an existing customer base.”",
            "“Without question it was a better experience: free, no red-eye flight, no hotel room charges, and better access to the Microsoft team,” Laron Walker, CEO of Mantisedu Inc., an Atlanta-based education hardware partner of Microsoft, told MarketWatch in a phone interview. “Last year, I paid several thousand dollars to attend, and if I was late for a session, I couldn’t rewind it. This year, I could.”",
            "Walker, 41, said he was able to view sessions at any time, pause them to take notes, and then pass them on to co-workers. He was also able to connect with Build speakers via LinkedIn and email because he had more information about them via their presentations. “This made me look at tech conferences in a whole new light,” he said.",
            "Developers conferences are as much an annual ritual in the tech industry as Apple Inc. AAPL, +0.64% product launches and gargantuan shows like CES and Mobile World Congress. All told, they set the narrative for developers and, eventually, consumers over the next year or two.",
            "May is usually the epicenter of such gatherings. Before COVID-19, executives, analysts, business partners, and the press had scheduled their travel schedules to attend Microsoft’s Build (May 19-21, in Seattle), Google parent Alphabet Inc.’s GOOGL, +0.46% GOOG, +0.54% I/O summit (May 12-14, Mountain View, Calif.), and Facebook Inc.’s FB, +1.52% F8 (May 5-6, in San Jose).",
            "Two of those shows were dropped while a third will be vastly restructured. For example:",
            "Apple: “We are delivering WWDC 2020 this June in an innovative way to millions of developers around the world, bringing the entire developer community together with a new experience,” Phil Schiller, Apple’s senior vice president of Worldwide Marketing, said in a statement May 5. “We look forward to sharing more details about WWDC20 with everyone as we get closer to this exciting event” on June 22. The event is free for all developers.",
            "Facebook: The company, which has vowed not to host events of more than 50 people until June 2021, is “still working through what F8 and more broadly what FB’s events/conference approach will be beyond June 2021,” a company spokesperson told MarketWatch.",
            "Google: Google canceled I/O altogether and declined to comment on the show next year. The show will go on, however, for Google Cloud Next ‘20, with more than 200 sessions over nine weeks, from July 14 through Sept. 8, a Google Cloud spokesperson told MarketWatch.",
            "Amazon: AWS Insights Online Conference is offering a free half-day “educational immersion” tutorial on media tech capabilities on May 28.",
            "The evolution of developer conferences was inevitable in an era of lightning-fast streaming services, content on demand, and videoconferencing. A developer in say, Spain, can binge-watch cloud-computing solutions on one channel while another in Brazil views an archived keynote speech at roughly the same time. If it sounds suspiciously like a viewing experience on Netflix or Walt Disney Co.’s DIS, +0.16% Disney+, that is the goal, she and others say.",
            "Microsoft was already in the process of “re-imaging” how to connect more with developers to improve engagement, accessibility, resources, and content before COVID-19 — which accelerated its plan, Charlotte Yarkoni, corporate vice president of cloud and AI at Microsoft, told MarketWatch in a phone interview.",
            "“People don’t like watching something that requires you to sit for four hours; they prefer content when they choose to watch regardless of time zones,” said Yarkoni, who called first-day demand and interest of Build “unprecedented.” She said interest in the weeks leading up to the two-day conference signaled that Build would experience a bump. Traffic for Microsoft Learn, a learning-platform for technical content usually used by developers, was up 272% in April, year-over-year, she said. What is more, Microsoft now has more than 72 million monthly active users across its technical documentation and learning sites.",
            "Perhaps, another tech executive suggests, the preponderance of consumers using Zoom Video Communications Inc. ZM, -0.56% has conditioned them to digest technical information online.",
            "“Business-to-business conferences like ours are dependent on people meeting in-person,” Okta Inc. OKTA, +2.53% CEO Todd McKinnon told MarketWatch in a phone interview. But his perception changed after this year’s edition of Oktane20 Live, an all-digital show in early April, drew record attendance. He’s now considering a permanent shift to a hybrid model of both in-person and digital attendees next year and beyond.",
            "“We had tons of leads and off-the-charts engagement with an all-digital format,” McKinnon said after 20,000 attended, compared with 6,000 a year ago.",
            "Nutanix Inc.’s NTNX, +2.49% Global .NEXT Digital Experience was to take place June 30-July 2 in Chicago. Now, it’s scheduled to be online in September.",
            "“COVID-19 has forced Nutanix to think outside the box,” Nutanix Inc. Chief Marketing Officer Ben Gibson told MarketWatch in an email. “Consumers can expect the same great content from our traditional in-person events but on a schedule that best suits them — from the comfort of their home office.”",
            "Before we write off the concept of the classic tech conference — even with the best of intentions and a treasure trove of content, there is no better way to network than in person, Collision’s Cosgrave points out. “Bigger conferences for meant for networking -- dinners, cocktails, late-night meetings,” he said. “The flurry of networking is the utility of conferences. Speakers and panels are an excuse to go.”",
            "“At the end of the day, we hope to be back in person in Toronto next year,” he said."

            "In the U.S., stores have fully or partially reopened across 25 states.",
            "“[F]or the 1,100-plus stores that have been open for at least a week, sales overall have been above last year across all states and countries where we are open,” said Ernie Herrman, chief executive of TJX on the earnings call, according to a FactSet transcript.",
            "The TJX TJX, -1.63% portfolio includes T.J. Maxx and Marshalls stores.",
            "Herrman attributed the showing to pent-up demand, the “treasure hunt experience” of shopping the company’s stores, and other factors.",

            "“In today’s environment, we believe this kind of shopping experience can serve as a break in the day and as some ‘me time’ for our customers and in the future will continue to be a major draw for consumers to our stores,” he said.",
            "TJX results for the first quarter swung to a loss and sales were nearly chopped in half due to the coronavirus pandemic and lockdowns. The company wrote down $500 million in inventory, largely on items that had already been reduced and were expected to be reduced further. The company expects to sell these items in the second quarter.",
            "Herrman makes the point that predicting consumer behavior is still a challenge in this environment, but analysts were upbeat after these initial signals.",
            "“TJX is seeing much better than feared traffic in stores that are reopening, suggesting many consumers are comfortable in off-price stores and continue to favor TJX’s value proposition,” wrote Cowen analysts led by Oliver Chen.",

            "“With sales trends inflecting to positive immediately, it settled the one key debate on off-price today, ‘Will shoppers feel comfortable returning to retail stores anytime soon?” With that question now answered (they will…), this is a very noteworthy development that likely gives bulls more ammo for their 2021 thesis.”",
            "Wells Fargo rates TJX overweight with a $70 up from $65.",
            "Ross Stores ROST, -3.08% , on the other hand, was “muted as usual” after announcing its results, Wells Fargo said.",

            "“While we didn’t come away with a read on recent performance (stores just began to open), we would expect Ross Stores to benefit similarly to TJX longer-term from strong consumer demand, a shrinking competitive landscape, and possibly the best product buying environment in off-price history (which we think is an added margin catalyst into next year),” wrote Roxanne Meyer, MKM Partners managing director.",

            "Republicans are brandishing the latest weapon in their uphill fight for U.S. House control this November: the massive new $3 trillion coronavirus relief bill proposed by Democrats promising benefits for immigrants who entered the U.S. illegally.",
            "They’re also celebrating their recent capture of a Democratic-held House seat north of Los Angeles. They say it shows they can win suburban districts whose centrist voters fled the GOP two years ago, costing it the chamber’s majority.",
            "Moderate districts ringing American cities are still the key House battleground. Yet five months from Election Day, Republican prospects for winning control seem slim.",
            "GOP candidates are burdened by President Donald Trump’s lingering unpopularity with suburban voters, his slow and erratic handling of the pandemic and an economy with only the faintest heartbeat. They face a potentially crippling fundraising disadvantage against pivotal Democratic incumbents.",
            "Coping with those disadvantages is all the more difficult for GOP congressional candidates in the era of Trump, who overshadows messaging by down-ballot contenders.",
            "“For many voters, the 2020 election will be a referendum on the president. That’s the bad news,” said former Rep. Charlie Dent, R-Pa.",
            "But GOP operatives see an opening with the next massive coronavirus aid bill crafted by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. It passed the House with support by just one Republican.",
            "Citing its direct payments for immigrant workers in the U.S. illegally and other “asinine provisions,” the House Republican campaign arm all but promised attack ads.",
            "The House bill is dead in the GOP-led Senate and opposed by Trump. Underscoring the discomfort it produced, 10 of the 30 Democrats from districts Trump carried in the 2016 election voted against the legislation.",
            "“For the Trump 30, anything Trump-related is in the danger zone,” said Scott Reed, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce’s senior political strategist.",
            "Yet Pelosi stuffed the bill with priorities Democrats could embrace, including nearly $1 trillion to help financially struggling local governments.",
            "“My ‘yes’ vote shows I’m trying to get $612 million back to my district,” said freshman Rep. Andy Kim, D-N.J., citing the share he said his communities would receive. Kim represents a central New Jersey district Trump won in 2016.",
            "Also buoying Democrats is moderate voters’ unremitting dislike for Trump’s abrasive behavior and harsh policies. The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll this month found 61% of suburban voters disapprove of Trump, little changed over three years.",
            "To counter that, Republicans have sought House candidates like Mike Garcia, who won this month’s Los Angeles-area special election. He’s a businessman, retired Navy fighter pilot and son of a Mexican immigrant.",
            "Garcia represents a nod toward diversity for the overwhelmingly white House GOP. Republicans have sought more female candidates, too, hoping to improve an embarrassing look: Just 13 of the 198 House Republicans are women, and two are retiring.",
            "Garcia has no prior political record for Democrats to attack, flipping the script on dozens of freshman Democrats seeking reelection who now must defend two years of congressional votes.",
            "Rep. Tom Emmer, R-Minn., who leads his chamber’s GOP campaign arm, wrote colleagues that Republicans can regain the House by “exploiting the legislative records of our opponents with our diverse field of candidates.”",
            "But money shortfalls are a problem.",
            "All 53 remaining House Democrats in seats the GOP targeted last year, mostly from Trump-won districts and freshmen, have outraised their Republican challengers. In all but 10 of those races, the Democrat had at least a 2-1 advantage.",
            "“For Republican challengers who don’t have high name ID, that kind of financial disadvantage is almost insurmountable,” said former Rep. Carlos Curbelo, R-Fla., who like Dent clashed with Trump.",
            "Only about four dozen of the House’s 435 districts seem seriously competitive. Republicans must gain 17 seats to win control.",
            "Since Republicans have more challengers than Democrats, they’ve been hurt more by the coronavirus shutdown. The lack of face-to-face events has complicated attracting public attention and badly impaired fundraising, especially for little-known upstarts.",
            "Despite virtual fundraisers and digital solicitations, both parties’ operatives say the ailing economy and lack of physical gatherings have significantly cut contributions. Democratic consultant Sarah Elizabeth Pole estimates a potential 50% drop in giving to congressional candidates this quarter, varying by campaign.",
            "“Some people may not be writing as big a check as they would have three months ago,” said Ashley Hinson, a Republican Iowa state legislator challenging Democratic Rep. Abby Finkenauer.",
            "Still, Hinson raised a healthy $1.6 million through March. And she said she’s “having the conversation” about possibly holding physical campaign events in late summer.",
            "Wide-ranging Republican attacks on Democrats have included accusations that they’re socialists and blasts for backing Pelosi to become speaker, impeaching Trump and not blaming China for the pandemic.",
            "With Trump and the economy setting the background tone, Democrats have focused on health care, which carried them to victory in 2018. They’re emphasizing Republican efforts to end former President Barack Obama’s health care law, which guarantees coverage for millions of Americans.",
            "“House Democrats are the firewall against Republican efforts to take away health care during this worldwide pandemic,” said Rep. Cheri Bustos, D-Ill., who leads her party’s House political team.",
            "Democrats must defend more seats, including from upstate New York and New York City’s Staten Island; Oklahoma City; Salt Lake City; Charleston, South Carolina; Iowa; and Virginia.",
            "Houston-area Democratic freshman Rep. Lizzie Fletcher, who is white, faces a well-funded GOP challenger in Wesley Hunt, a black Army veteran. In California’s Orange County, freshman Rep. Gil Cisneros, who’s Latino, has a rematch against Young Kim, a Korean American former state assemblywoman.",
            "Republicans seem certain to lose two North Carolina seats with redrawn district lines and could lose another in west Texas. They’re defending vulnerable seats in Pennsylvania; central Illinois; Syracuse, New York; and suburban Atlanta, Dallas and Houston. Higher November turnout may help Democrats oust Garcia in California.",
            "Whatever campaigning looks like, Democrats have been drawn to the formulation Republican Ronald Reagan used to help win the 1980 presidential election.",
            "“I ask people, ‘Do you like being sicker, poorer and weaker than you were four years ago?’” said Sri Kulkarni, a Democrat seeking a suburban Houston seat vacated by a Republican. “Because that’s the situation we’re in right now.”"

            "The bottle:Singani 63, $30-$35 (varies upon market)",
            "The back story: Filmmaker Steven Soderbergh is famous for many things: his remarkable debut picture “Sex, Lies and Videotape” (1989), his Oscar-winning turn as director of the crime drama “Traffic” (2000), his madcap series of “Ocean’s” heist pictures with George Clooney, Brad Pitt and others. And let’s not forget “Contagion” (2011), his prescient look at how the world would be upended by a deadly pandemic.",
            "But away from the camera, Soderbergh has another mission: making an obscure Bolivian spirit a global favorite.",
            "The spirit is called singani — Soderbergh’s brand is Singani 63 — and it’s similar to an unaged brandy (or what’s also called an eau de vie). That is, it’s made from fruit — in this case a special grape variety, sourced from high in the Andes mountains",
            "Soderbergh came upon singani while working on the two-part biopic “Che” (2008) about the Argentinian-born Marxist leader Ernesto “Che” Guevara. Until then, “I was a vodka drinker, basically,” he told us. But he found something beguiling about the sip — specifically, its floral bouquet and the “very complex activity that goes on in your palate” as you enjoy it. But given that the product is extremely hard to find, particularly in the U.S., he soon decided to launch his own brand.",
            "The filmmaker admits that, at first, he didn’t know exactly what he was doing. “I found myself with 250 cases in a warehouse in New Jersey with no plan,” he says. But over time, he has built a small market for Singani 63, particularly through some of his quirky promotional efforts. He has a tongue-in-cheek sales sheet for the brand that includes bon mots like this: “I know Singani 63 is an exceptional product the same way I know they faked the moon landing and Marilyn Monroe was actually a man. Trust me on this.”",
            "These days, Soderbergh is still making movies, but also still promoting Singani 63. And sometimes, he combines his passions. He now has a video series, called “Stir Crazy,” that features prominent mixologists showcasing cocktails made with Singani 63.",
            "Oh, and Soderbergh isn’t gloating over the fact that his movie “Contagion” basically predicted the current pandemic. He says the possibility was obvious to anyone who paid attention to the warning signs from the health community. “This is the walking definition of something you’ve seen coming,” he says.",
            "What we think about it: Singani 63 is indeed a beguiling spirit — warming to the tongue and full of delicate herbaceous flavors. We think of it as a pleasing digestif, something on which to end a meal on a comforting note.",
            "How to enjoy it: Yes, you can have Singani 63 as an after-dinner sip. But Soderbergh would also like you to consider it as a base spirit for any number of mixed drinks. The brand website offers possibilities ranging from a variation of the Vesper cocktail to something called the Bolivian 63."

            "KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) — A Republican congressman from Kansas says he has been taking a malaria drug being touted by President Donald Trump as a way to protect against the coronavirus, despite warnings that it could have potentially fatal side effects.",
            "U.S. Rep. Roger Marshall, who is running for the U.S. Senate, said he doesn’t have COVID-19 but is taking hydroxychloroquine as a preventative drug. His parents, siblings and wife also are taking the drug, a spokesman for Marshall told the Kansas City Star on Tuesday.",
            "“I would encourage any person over the age of 65 or with an underlying medical condition to talk to their own physician about taking hydroxychloroquine and I’m relieved President Trump is taking it,” Marshall reportedly told the Wall Street Journal, which first reported the congressman’s use of the drug.",
            "Trump said Monday that he has been taking the drug and a zinc supplement for more than a week. His decision comes despite guidance from health officials in his administration that the drug should be administered only in hospital or research settings.",
            "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration last month warned doctors not to prescribe hydroxychloroquine to treat the coronavirus outside of hospitals or research settings because of reports of serious side effects, including irregular heart rhythms and death among patients. Preliminary results from a study done on coronavirus patients at U.S. veterans hospitals showed no benefit, casting more doubt on the drug’s efficacy during the pandemic.",
            "Marshall, though, has defended the use of the drug, saying previously that “in many cases, patients have a lot to gain and little to lose if they consider taking it.”",
            "In the U.S. Senate race, Marshall, an obstetrician, is still struggling to consolidate opponents of his main rival, immigration hardliner and former Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach. In a crowded GOP field, Marshall faces attacks from the right, with a political action committee for the small-government, free-market group Club for Growth planning to spend $2.2 million on anti-Marshall ads starting in mid-June.",

            "GOP candidates in the race have been stressing their loyalty to Trump. Kobach, backed by Trump in his failed 2018 run for governor, was the first prominent Kansas elected official to endorse Trump in 2016.

            "But as sports leagues look to restart, there are a few guidelines they should follow to avoid the risks of the coronavirus pandemic. Dr. Glenn Copeland, medical advisor for the Toronto Blue Jays and advisor to QuestCap, a company working with sports leagues to bring sports back, says leagues should adhere to the following guidelines in order to make the return of sports safe for players, fans and stadium workers.",
            "Divide facilities into three zones",
            "“Each facility will have three distinct areas. The outside zone is the free zone where the world lives. The middle zone is at the entrance of the facility/arena where all participants, players, coaches, trainers, and equipment managers will be tested,” Copeland told MarketWatch.",
            "The third zone is the “inner zone” where those who tested negative for COVID-19 can go. It’s also where the actual games and competitions will take place.",
            "“ “Getting in is like getting into Fort Knox.” ”",
            "These are guidelines for situations where there are no fans.",
            "Every time a person wishes to enter the inner zone, they must first get tested in the arena entrance, aka the middle zone. No exceptions. When and if a person tests negative for coronavirus, they will be allowed to enter the inner zone.",
            "Copeland outlines that it’s unnecessary for those who passed through the middle zone to wear any lanyards or wristbands to prove they have tested negative for COVID-19. This is because only those who are virus-free can enter that zone.",
            "“Getting in is like getting into Fort Knox.”",
            "People will be able to just walk out of the protected inner zone to enter the outside zone. Specialized personnel like players might get a quick temperature check and symptom check on the way out of the inner zone, according to Copeland, but most others can leave as they wish.",
            "This concept is similar to how airports work -- a series of checkpoints to get in, but leaving the protected area is as easy as walking out.",
            "“Once the testing proves the participant is COVID-free, they will be allowed into the inner zone, which will be as COVID-free as possible. This testing will be done every day as the participants leave the outer zone and look for admission into the playing facility/inner zone,” Copeland explains.",
            "Even in the outer zone, all people should be maintaining social distancing guidelines.",
            "Test everybody, everyday",
            "“Everybody. Anybody going to the inner zone. Media, players, coaches, cleaners, food service. Everybody,” Copeland says.",
            "As stated above, testing will be conducted in the middle zone as a prerequisite to gain access to the inner zone.",
            "Testing everybody going to the inner zone is more feasible because there will be “absolutely no fans” at the events, according to Copeland. While no official rules have been released about the presence of fans, most reporting on the resumption of sports indicates fans will not be present.",
            "“It will include antibody/antigen testing, nasal swab testing when indicated, temperature checks, symptom checks, and evaluation by a healthcare provider before entering into the inner zone.”",

            "Gather daily intel on all participants",
            "“The gathering of all medical data on all participants on a day-to-day basis is also mandatory and much will be learned for the sports and the medical world as we continually monitor healthy athletes,” Copeland recommends.",
            "Copeland recommends gathering data whenever people change zones. Test results, symptoms and temperature will be recorded in the middle zone by both league and team personnel with private data encryption software.",
            "See also: Michael Jordan memorabilia explodes amid ‘Last Dance’ popularity",
            "“Hopefully, we will be able to pick up early symptoms, whether it relates to temperature changes or physical symptoms or blood-work, that may indicate an early stage infection starting. Finds like these would be very helpful as we look at the new world of sports so that we may recognize possible early-stage infections and prevent the spread.”",
            "As of now, sports leagues have not stated how present family members of players, coaches, or team personnel will be when the leagues resume play.",
            "Athletes must change how they interact",
            "“There can be no high-fiving, hugging, congratulatory slaps, or any close contact that is not part of the actual sport. Water bottles, towels, and other equipment like warm-up bats can no longer be shared,” Copeland advises.",
            "Players going out of their way to avoid congratulating each other with a hug or high-five will seem strange to viewers but Copeland says it’s a major way to reduce risk.",
            "Additionally, there is a higher risk factor in a sport like basketball than baseball when it comes to in-game contact. In baseball there is hardly any physical touching, while basketball players make contact with one another on almost every play.",
            "“All equipment in the weight room and other areas will need to be sanitized between each player’s use. All uniforms and personal equipment will be sanitized on a day-to-day basis, including padding, helmets, jerseys, and undergarments. Every clubhouse should be fully sanitized at least twice every 24 hours.”",
            "Social distancing must remain in place, even within the “inner zone”",
            "“Social distancing in the clubhouse, lunchroom, weight room, and trainers room must be obeyed. Self-regulation by all participants will be very important...where these participants eat, sleep, and socialize will become most important,” Copeland says.",
            "Copeland claims that even inside the safest of the three outlined zones, large gatherings should not be permitted.",
            "“There will be no large gatherings, especially outside of the inner zone. Unfortunately, there will be no intermingling with fans, no signing of autographs, and no socializing with friends who are not part of the participating team.”",

            "This is a textbook case of financial abuse. In fact, here is a direct quote from the Office on Women’s Health at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services: “Financial abuse happens when an abuser takes control of finances to prevent the other person from leaving and to maintain power in a relationship. An abuser may take control of all the money, withhold it, and conceal financial information from the victim.” You are inside of it, so you not be able to see it for what it is.",
            "He has no legal right to keep your money. The economic impact payment is technically an advance payment of a tax credit on your 2020 return. The IRS is using 2019 tax returns to gauge people’s incomes; 2018 tax returns are used as a Plan B. I don’t see any compassion, trust or respect in his actions — just some of the hallmarks of a loving relationship. Financial abuse is a form of domestic violence.

            "‘I’ll never give my wife $1,200 to blow her stimulus check. She’ll get a couple of hundred bucks to go shopping.’ What’s wrong with that?",
            "If you filed jointly, you share the money. “Even if your husband earns more money, there is a tax benefit of claiming two deductions — one for each spouse — on the returns,” says David Waltzer, a New York-based lawyer. “So, without you, there would certainly be less of a tax credit. Also, if there were a tax liability — money owed to the IRS — you would be on the hook. So it is outrageous that a spouse would share liability for tax debt, but not share in the tax credit.",
            "“It might be valuable to look at equitable distribution principles that apply to divorced couples,” Waltzer said. “The premise is that if one spouse earns more, the other spouse is entitled to some of the value from those earnings. Why? Because it is presumed that the lower-earning spouse is contributing in other ways, maybe with household management, laundry, food, shopping etc.. That contribution (sweat equity) supports and frees the earning spouse to make the money.”",
            "‘We will not have a vaccine by next winter.’ Like the 1918 Spanish flu, CDC says second wave of coronavirus could be worse. So what happens now?",
            "Not only do these principles apply to your stimulus check, but Waltzer says there is even a stronger case for the equal division of stimulus checks. “They are supposed to be $1,200 per person, for example. So if a $2,400 check arrives into one spouse’s account, $1,200 of that belongs to the other spouse. Lastly, even if none of the above convinces your husband, tell him to be a mensch and not a grinch and to stop giving you a hard time — just out of sheer decency and love.”",
            "I received my ex-husband’s $1,200 stimulus check because we filed joint taxes in 2018. Should I give him the money or return it to the IRS?",
            "That’s the legal opinion on your case, with some free relationship advice thrown in for good measure. You are in a difficult position during this lockdown. You could call your husband’s bank, but if the account is in his name, it will be difficult — if not near impossible — to persuade a bank to transfer that money to your account. The Internal Revenue Service is sending out millions of stimulus payments to people, so I’d be very surprised if they were able to send another one to you separately.",
            "Your best course of action for now: Keep notes of all of these events with dates, and other details, and use them to motivate yourself to take action when the economy starts up again. You can also use this time to consult a family attorney in your area to explore your options. Are you happy in your marriage? Is your husband’s refusal to give you your stimulus check some kind of aberration? You are the best one to answer that.",
            "If not, you not only have a right to that $1,200 stimulus payment, you also have a right to be happy. But only you can make that happen.",

            "As investors navigate the coronavirus recession, the financial crisis a decade ago looms large in their collective memory, with pessimists arguing that the resulting bear market took 18 months to hit its lowest point and optimists countering that swift and decisive action from the Federal Reserve and Congress this time around has saved the stock market from that fate.",
            "Michael Wilson, head of U.S. equity strategy at Morgan Stanley is squarely in the bull camp, arguing in a Monday note to clients that the current stock market looks uncannily like March 2009, when the U.S. economy was emerging from the crisis, and the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.23% was beginning its longest bull-market run in history.",
            "“Markets are tracking the Great Financial Crisis period very closely in many ways,” Wilson wrote, adding that stocks have rebounded in a “similar pattern” to March 2009, at the same time that the number of individual stocks trading above their 200-day moving average has begun to climb, supported by “cyclical stocks” like small-capitalization stocks, which typically lead at the beginning of recoveries.",
            "Another important similarity between the two periods is the equity-risk premium, or the expected earnings yield for the S&P 500 minus the 10-year Treasury yield, which gives investors a rough estimate of the extra return they’ll get investing in stocks compared with risk-free government bonds.",
            "“A significant driver of our bullish call in March was based on the equity-risk premium reaching the same levels observed in March 2009,” Wilson wrote, referring to his calling a stock-market bottom on March 16, just a week before the S&P 500 closed at its recent low of 2,237 on March 23.",
            "“If there’s one thing we’ve learned over the past 10 years, it’s that when risk premium appears you need to grab it before it disappears,” he said. The risk premium will fall either when bond prices fall and interest rates rise or when equity prices rise, thereby reducing their expected return.",
            "Though traditional cyclical stocks like small-caps have outperformed of late — the Russell 2000 RUT, has risen 8.3% during the past month versus the S&P 500’s 2.9% rise — others, like financial stocks have not. In fact, bank stocks are performing worse relative to the S&P 500 than during the bank-driven financial crisis.",
            "Wilson explained this dynamic by arguing that the very same Fed stimulus that has truncated the coronavirus bear market is repressing government bond yields in a way that is scaring bank investors. “The biggest headwind for banks is the persistently low level of rates,” particularly for longer-term debt, Wilson wrote. Low interest rates hurt banks because they lower the profit margins they can earn by issuing loans.",
            "But Wilson believes the market is underestimating the chances that longer-term bond yields, like the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note TMUBMUSD10Y, 0.693%, will rise significantly as the economy rebounds from coronavirus, and is therefore underestimating chances for a huge rally in financial-sector stocks.",
            "He pointed to Congress passing at least $3 trillion in fiscal stimulus, the potential for a faster and more sustained recovery in the post-coronavirus economy and unexpected inflation as demand returns before supply chains can adjust as possible catalysts for higher inflation and long-term interest rates.",
            "“While hypothetical, these are real possibilities and worth considering given current levels of inflation and 10-year Treasury yields,” Wilson wrote. “We continue to think higher 10-year rates would be perhaps the biggest surprise to markets at the moment and would have significant implications for equity markets and leadership.”"

            "While many Americans have used their stimulus checks to cover basic needs such as groceries, mortgage or rent, there’s evidence people are also spending the money on non-essentials including electronics, clothes and toys, according to major retailers.",
            "“Call it relief spending, as it was heavily influenced by stimulus dollars, leading to sales increases in categories such as apparel, televisions, video games, sporting goods and toys,” Walmart WMT, -0.52% Chief Executive Doug McMillon said during the company’s earnings call Tuesday.",
            "Target TGT, -1.00%, BJ’s Wholesale Club Holdings Inc. BJ, +5.22% and Best Buy Co. BBY, -1.35% also saw increased consumer demand for discretionary goods in mid-April as the stimulus payments from the $2.2-trillion CARES Act flowed into Americans’ bank accounts, the companies’ CEOs said this week. Apple AAPL, +0.64% saw an uptick in demand for its products “across the board,” CEO Tim Cook said April 30.",
            "Related: Best Buy’s stock rises after profit, revenue and same-store sales fall less than expected",
            "“ At Walmart and Target, shoppers bought more TVs, electronics, gaming equipment and apparel. Walmart also saw more demand for adult-sized bikes. ”",
            "At Walmart, Target, shoppers bought more TVs, electronics, gaming equipment and apparel. Walmart also saw increased demand for adult-sized bikes.",
            "BJ’s CEO Lee Delaney told investors on Thursday that the company saw “relatively significant growth” in discretionary categories, including electronics and TVs.",
            "“We would imagine that there is certainly an impact from stimulus checks that are impacting the business,” Delaney said. “But I think it’s right to assume there is some benefit flowing through from stimulus checks in the business.”",
            "(BJ’s did not respond to a request for a further comment.)",
            "At Best Buy, customers used their stimulus checks to buy computing and gaming equipment, Corie Barry, the company’s CEO, said on it Thursday earnings call.",
            "“Like many other retailers, we saw sales benefit during the last three weeks of the quarter as customers undoubtedly chose to spend some of their government stimulus money on the products and services we provide,” Barry said.",
            "(Best Buy did not respond to a request for a further comment.)",
            "The different phases of the pandemic have shaped shoppers’ choices. As stay-at-home orders were enacted across the country, “parents became teachers,” McMillon said on Walmart’s earnings call. “Adult bicycles started selling out, as parents started to join the kids. An overlapping trend then started emerging related to DIY and home-related activities.”",
            "Consumers also bought sewing machines and bandanas to make their own face masks, he said.",
            "Sales took off in mid-April when many Americans began to receive their $1,200 stimulus checks. Within 10 days of receiving their stimulus checks, households spent around one quarter to one third of it, research shows.",
            "See also: Walmart spent nearly $900 million on the coronavirus in Q1 and says it’s a ‘reasonable assumption’ that they’ll spend that much in Q2",
            "Before the checks were issued on April 15, there was “not as much demand” for discretionary goods at Walmart, said spokesman Randy Hargrove, adding that sales increased “towards the end of the quarter.”",
            "Target Corp. also experienced “a rapid increase in traffic and sales” for discretionary goods driven by the distribution of stimulus checks, CEO Brian Cornell said on the company’s Wednesday earnings call. “We certainly saw an uptick as we reported starting on April 15, as those checks arrived across America,” Cornell said on the company’s call.",
            "“ Before the checks were issued on April 15, there was ‘not as much demand’ for discretionary goods at Walmart, said spokesman Randy Hargrove ”",
            "Customers, he said, are “still seeing the benefits of the stimulus check.” People are shopping across all categories including apparel, which has been especially hard hit by the coronavirus-driven economic downturn.",
            "(Costco COST, +0.15% declined to comment on whether it has experienced the same trend in sales related to stimulus payments.)",
            "iPhone maker Apple also saw sales increase after stimulus payments went out, Cook said on the company’s April 30 earnings call. “A part of it is due to just our new products,” Cook said. But another part of it is also “due to the stimulus programs taking effect in April.” (Apple did not respond to MarketWatch’s request for a further comment.)",
            "Unlike Target and Walmart, which have remained open during the coronavirus outbreak and can sell apparel in-stores, “non-esential” clothing retailers including Gap GAP, +2.04%, Nordstrom NRD, +2.12% and Nike NKE, -0.54% have been forced to close many stores across the country. As a result, retailers in the apparel industry have offered consumers online deals comparable to Cyber Monday.",
            "Still, many Americans have used their stimulus checks to stock up on essentials. That’s especially true for those who received their checks in the first wave of stimulus payments, said Stuart Sopp, CEO and founder of Current, a New York City-based mobile-banking startup.",
            "In mid-April when payments were initially distributed, “most people immediately spent on groceries,” said Sopp. Many Current members, he said, also took cash out of ATMs to “pay friends back and pay their bills.” He added, “People were struggling for basic life essentials and the stimulus payments really helped them, which I think is what it was all about.”",
            "In the next wave of payments, which occurred towards the end of April, more people used the funds “for everyday means,” Sopp said. That included ordering more food delivery and takeout, and gas.",
            "The $3 trillion coronavirus aid package the House of Representatives passed last week, dubbed the HEROS Act, calls for a second round of stimulus checks. President Donald Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell indicated that they are in no rush to sign the relief package to law. Trump has shown support for a second round of stimulus checks.",
            "If people do end up receiving a second stimulus check, Sopp predicts most will use the money for the same purposes.",
            "Best Buy’s Barry said Thursday that “the impact of current to potential future government stimulus actions” is something the company will keep an eye on “for the remainder of the year.”"

            "In light of the continuing pandemic, Congress has temporarily changed the rules on hardship withdrawals from your 401(k). It’s easier to take money out penalty-free, up to $100,000, and you can pay it back and avoid the tax hit.",
            "But should you even think about raiding your 401(k) plan? Vanguard, the investment firm founded by the legendary late Jack Bogle, took on this problem in a recent update to clients.",
            "The summary idea is to borrow from your plan rather than withdraw from it during difficult times such as the COVID-19 pandemic.",
            "“The law allows plans that offer loans to adopt a provision to double the amount that participants can borrow to $100,000 or 100% of the vested account balance, whichever is less,” Vanguard said.",
            "“This is available until September 23, 2020. If your plan usually charges a loan origination fee, it will be waived. To be eligible, you must be affected by the coronavirus.”",
            "If you do take money, start small, Vanguard cautions. And definitely plan ahead for how to repay yourself within those three years.",
            "“Your ability to access money for the short-term needs of today but pay yourself back is important. It means you won’t owe taxes on the money and you also won’t wipe out your hard-earned, long-term retirement funding,” the company said.",
            "All sound advice — if you consider your 401(k) to be your retirement plan. The data on Americans and their savings habits suggest otherwise: For many people it’s a rainy-day fund at best. Many likely will have few qualms about tapping it early.",
            "Fidelity Investments reports that the average 401(k) balance among its participants ages 50 to 59 was $179,100 as of the third quarter of 2018. But the median balance was far less, just $62,700.",
            "For the group 10 years older, ages 60 to 69, the average balance was $198,600 but the median barely budged, rising a measly $300 to $63,000.",
            "Which brings me to a powerful point made not long ago by Bogle himself — 401(k) plans are not really retirement plans. They simply aren’t strict enough.",
            "“At first, the 401(k) was designed to be a thrift plan, an extra, a savings plan. It was never designed to be a retirement plan. You can see it in its very structure,” Bogle said in an interview.",
            "“There’s no requirement to put money in, no requirement to pull it out. It’s too flexible. There ought to be more discipline in it.”",
            "The same thing is true of the IRA, Bogle pointed out. “It’s very flexible, and I think that should be tightened up, too, but particularly the 401(k) and 403(b). They both have a lot of flexibility and, in a lot of cases, too much cost,” he said.",
            "We know what happens when people are required to make contributions to their own retirement. That’s how Social Security works. For all its faults, Social Security is highly disciplined. Everyone who works puts money in and everyone who retires takes money out as income.",
            "Nevertheless, a shocking number of people simply ignore the opportunity to save for retirement in a 401(k) plan — up to 60% of eligible workers, according to one study. While 80% of baby boomers join a plan if offered one, just 52% of millennials participate.",
            "What can you do now to overcome the design flaws Bogle points out?",
            "First, save more. Many financial planners would point to 10% as a minimum savings rate for people trying to retire decades from today. Vanguard data show that the average 401(k) contribution in 2018 was 6.9% of pay. Just one in five 401(k) participants save more than 10% of their salary for retirement.",
            "Second, it’s easy to underestimate the value of keeping investment costs low, as Bogle notes. High-fee funds eat up a giant slice of your long-term gains, as much as a third of your return or more. Low cost is the point of using index funds in retirement plans such as 401(k)s and IRAs.",
            "Borrowing from your plan or worse, withdrawing cash, means your money stops working for you into the future. You miss out on the powerful effect of compounding. But so does failing to contribute enough in the first place. That’s how you end up with a rainy-day fund instead of a real retirement plan.",
            "Starting early, saving enough and managing cost allows you to use time as leverage. At a 10% savings rate over decades even people of moderate means can compound their savings in the stock market and have enough to retire without worry.",

            "Investors searching hard for elusive dividend yield might consider this unusual solution: Buy shares of established, high-quality technology-sector companies that pay decent dividends. ",
            "Established tech companies have been around for a while and have proven advantages over newer competitors. They have financial strength and reliable cash flow, so their yields are safe. Unlike richly priced bonds, shares of these companies can offer decent long-term capital appreciation in the form of rising stock prices as the global economy recovers and sales expand. ",
            "Here are five stocks to consider. I’ve suggested each of these companies in my stock newsletter, Brush Up on Stocks, because of their dividend, the strength of their competitive advantages, and insider buying. Another reason is they have large market capitalizations, so these shares have ample trading liquidity.",
            "These companies also are financially solid based on their “Altman Z scores.” This measure blends gauges of financial strength including working capital, retained earnings, cash flow and sales compared to assets, and market cap compared to liabilities. An Altman Z-score of 3.0 or greater indicates balance sheet strength, according to Goldman Sachs Chief U.S. Equity Strategist David Kostin. That’s better than the S&P 500 SPX, +0.23% average of 2.8.",
            "Each of these six stocks are currently reasonably priced despite recent gains, considering they still trade near- or below their P/E levels during the worst of the 2008-09 financial crisis. Altman Z-Scores and March 2009 P/E ratios come from Kostin. ",
            "1. Intel",
            "Dividend yield 2.2%",
            "Market cap: $250 billion",
            "Altman Z-Score: 3.8",
            "Forward P/E: 13.0",
            "March 2009 forward P/E: 24.0",
            "Former Intel CEO Andy Grove famously observed that bad companies are destroyed by crisis, good companies survive them, and great companies are improved by them. He’d be happy to know that the company he helped build into a tech sector giant remains firmly in the latter category. ",
            "When Grove was in charge, Intel INTC, +0.44% rode the PC wave, in the “Wintel” alliance with Microsoft MSFT, +0.04% . Then Intel wisely saw around the corner to position itself with excellent semiconductor products for cloud computing and mobile devices, the next two big trends. ",
            "Data centers servers are mostly run with Intel chips, says Morningstar analyst Abhinav Davuluri. “The shift to the cloud has been a massive tailwind for Intel, and we suspect this trend remains in the early innings as AI proliferates and demands more specialized chips,” he adds. Data center division sales advanced 43% in the first quarter, compared to 23% revenue growth overall.",
            "Intel is also a big player chips supporting 5G — the next big trend in mobile communications. It also benefits from the work from home trend — which will probably remain with us after COVID-19 risks fade, because a lot of people and companies have gotten used to it. This will continue to boost PC demand. ",
            "Intel is ramping up several cutting-edge 10-nanometer products this year, such as its Tiger Lake processors for laptops, Ice Lake server chips, and 5G Snow Ridge base station chips. It will get its 7-nanometer processor business back on track in 2021.",
            "2. Texas Instruments",
            "Dividend yield 3.1%",
            "Market cap: $102 billion",
            "Altman Z-Score: 11.7",

            "Texas Instruments TXN, -0.02% makes analog and embedded chips used in virtually everything — from toothbrushes and electrical grids to smartphones, data centers, military gear and cars, PCs and medical devices.",
            "These chips aren’t easy to design and make, which protects the company from competition. They also don’t cost much, so it’s not worth it for customers to change suppliers. Both factors add up to the kind of protective moat around the business that Berkshire Hathaway Chairman Warren Buffett likes to see. ",
            "Texas Instruments chips handle crucial tasks including processing data, managing power, and converting aspects of the analog world such as sound or temperature into digital signals. Texas Instruments benefits from all the major tech trends, like cloud computing, the popularity of digital products and the Internet of Things. ",
            "The company says it will continue to run its factories at first-quarter 2020 levels, which is probably smart since chip makers slashed production during the 2008 financial crisis and then had trouble meeting demand when it snapped back. ",
            "3. Qualcomm",
            "Dividend yield: 3.3%",
            "Market cap: $90 billion",
            "Altman Z-Score: 3.0",

            "Each time someone buys a mobile phone, Qualcomm QCOM, +0.89% makes a little bit of revenue. That’s because Qualcomm is the brains behind much of the knowhow that powers smartphones, including code division multiple access (CDMA) for third generation (3G) wireless networks, and orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) for 4G. ",
            "The wireless world is now on the cusp of another big network upgrade to 5G, and Qualcomm has a hand here, too. Qualcomm isn’t as domineering in this area, but 5G phones have to be backward-compatible, so they contain 3G- and 4G capability. ",
            "The upshot: Qualcomm’s licensing business will continue to see solid growth for years to come as 5G ramps up. The company also designs chips used in smartphones, but licensing and royalty business represents about 75% of operating income.",
            "Importantly, COVID-19 doesn’t seem to be hurting the roll out of 5G. It’s a leading indicator for the health of Qualcomm, says the company’s CFO Akash Palkhiwala, so this is key for investors. Surprisingly, Qualcomm maintained its 2020 guidance for its 5G business in its late April earnings call. “We feel very comfortable with the full year guidance,” Palkhiwala told investors. ",
            "In a hint of what may come soon to the rest of the world, about three-fourths of mobile phones launched in China so far this year were 5G. Qualcomm also benefits from two major long-term trends: The increasing wireless capabilities in cars especially as they add self-driving capabilities, and the Internet of Things.",
            "4. Cognizant Technology Solutions",
            "Dividend yield: 1.7%",

            "Altman Z-Score: 6",
            "Forward P/E: 14.7",
            "March 2009 forward P/E: 11",
            "For over a decade, this IT consulting and outsourcing company was the darling of growth investors. Since early 2018 shares of Cognizant Technology Solutions CTSH, -0.56% have wobbled because growth slowed — and worse. Cognizant got caught up in a bribery scandal in India, and earlier this year it was crippled by a malware attack that the company believes will cost $70 million to handle.",
            "It’s embarrassing when the tech experts you are supposed to rely on for advice on how to avoid malware attacks get crippled by one. Another issue now is Cognizant’s large exposure to financial service companies, which are suffering damage because of the weak economy and the flattening of the Treasury yield curve. ",
            "All of these problems seem like one-offs to me. Memories of scandals and mishaps fade. The economy will come back. Meanwhile, Cognizant continues to invest to expand its reach in hot areas of tech like the cloud, automation, analytics, the Internet of Things, and social media.",
            "Cognizant gets about 75% of its revenue from North America, so it is relatively immune to trade wars. This also implies plenty of room for growth in other parts of the world. Investors don’t really believe (which makes this a contrarian play) but “reacceleration in growth is not farfetched,” says Morningstar analyst Julie Bhusal Sharma.",
            "5. Analog Devices",
            "Dividend yield: 2.3%",

            "Like Texas Instruments, Analog Devices ADI, +0.04% is a big player in the analog chip space — especially signal processing chips. Its expertise and product lineup make it a bet on some of the biggest tech trends around. These include 5G, self-driving and electric cars (which require more and more advanced technology and sensing capabilities), and the increasing sophistication of industrial equipment. Plus, Analog Devices has a decent protective moat around its business because of its design knowhow and customer switching costs.",

            "“We’ll adjust salary to your location at that point,” he said, noting it will be necessary to take taxes into account. “There’ll be severe ramifications for people who are not honest about this.”",
            "That may put a crimp in the plans of some workers hoping to make their salaries go a lot farther in cheaper areas. A recent survey of San Francisco Bay Area tech workers found two-thirds would consider moving away from the pricey area if they could work remotely. “It makes no sense paying Bay Area rent if we can earn our salary living elsewhere,” one startup employee told Bloomberg News.",
            "As of 2018, the median employee compensation at Facebook was more than $240,000 a year. The median home price in Menlo Park, Calif., where the tech giant has its headquarters, is $2.4 million, according to Zillow, while the median home price in the wider Bay Area was $928,000 last year.",
            "Zuckerberg said that in a company survey, of the people who said they would want to work remotely full time, about 45% were “pretty confident” that they would move to another place if they had that opportunity, with an additional 30% saying they “might” move. About 60% of that total said they’d prefer to move to a smaller city or town.",
            "Ultimately, Zuckerberg said the changes will help Facebook become more diverse in its workforce.",

            "About 95% of Facebook’s employees are currently working from home due to coronavirus stay-at-home orders. The company has previously said workers will be able to work from home at least through the end of the year."

            "If you rebuild the workplace after COVID-19, will the workers ever come back?",
            "In Silicon Valley, the answer from many tech companies is that many won’t, and maybe that’s a good thing.",
            "In recent days, Twitter Inc. TWTR, +0.86% has said that employees have the option of never coming back to the office to work, while Facebook Inc. FB, +1.52%, Google parent Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, +0.46% GOOG, +0.54%, Salesforce.com Inc. CRM, +1.47% and Slack Technologies Inc. WORK, +0.22% have said they don’t expect workers back in the office until 2021 — if then.",
            "That just may be the beginning: At least six prominent tech companies are considering permanently moving a large slice of their workforces to work-from-home status, their chief executives told MarketWatch this week.",
            "“It’s hard to not see 20% to 40% of our workforce be remote,” Slack CEO Stewart Butterfield told MarketWatch in an interview Thursday on — appropriately enough — a Zoom ZM, -0.56% video call.",
            "“We need to make real-estate decisions long in advance, two to three years, and are in the speculative conversation now if we have 30%, 40% fewer desks,” Butterfield said in discussing conversations he was having with fellow Slack executives this week. “We may make the office more of a hotel.”",
            "Don’t miss: Companies reveal their plans for what work will look like when America returns to the office",
            "The COVID-19 pandemic forcing those who could work from home to do so has led to a surprising result — improved productivity. U.S. workers were 47% more productive in March and April than in the same two months a year ago through cloud-based business tools, chat applications and email, according to an analysis of 100 million data points from 30,000 Americans by workplace-monitoring company Prodoscore.",
            "“I was pretty wrong about this. I thought productivity was going to plunge, but it has been very good,” Okta Inc. CEO Todd McKinnon OKTA, +2.53% added, as the company considers a new dynamic work initiative. He said he could see Okta following Twitter’s path “until there is a vaccine or a treatment.”",
            "As small businesses and nonessential services slowly begin to reopen, tech CEOs like Butterfield and McKinnon OKTA, +2.53% are in internal discussions about fundamental changes to their workforces with far-reaching social implications. Not only are they open to letting a majority of employees work remotely; they’re vastly scaling back travel and attendance at conferences, hiring talent from all parts of the country, reducing office space and using the office as a place to socialize as much as work.",
            "The financial impact on cities like San Francisco and Seattle, where tech is the chief economic engine, could be devastating. Use of commercial real estate and public transit are likely to decline. Restaurants, bars and other gathering spots could be endangered. And then there is the toll on workers, many of whom feel increasingly isolated and stressed, worried about the security of their jobs even as they log long shifts at home.",
            "But that is the collateral damage from a new workforce that could also save companies billions of dollars in operational costs; greatly reduce traffic and liability related to sick employees; and enhance productivity from a workforce that eats, sleeps and lives at its diffuse, de facto offices. Tech is uniquely positioned to take advantage of working conditions turned upside down and sideways because it has the technical resources to support a decentralized workforce, and a significant slice of its employees already worked remotely.",
            "In a free-wheeling “virtual dinner” this week attended by five software CEOs — McKinnon, Box Inc.’s BOX, +6.70% Aaron Levie, PagerDuty Inc.’s PD, +4.38% Jennifer Tejada, Twilio Inc.’s TWLO, +7.53% Jeff Lawson and Zuora Inc.’s ZUO, +6.25% Tien Tzuo — the topic elicited the most animated conversation.",
            "See also: Twitter employees can work from home as long as they wish",
            "“Twitter will cause a snowball of other organizations going forward,” said Levie, who has weaned on the management style of former Intel Corp. INTC, +0.44% CEO Andy Grove, who weaved through offices to get an up-close look at workers. “We may not go back to work the same way [at Box]. Things are faster, more action-oriented with remote workers. With videoconferencing, I can check in on customers in the U.S., Japan and Europe in one day.”",
            "“Our salespeople meet five to eight customers a day now [via videoconferencing] versus the one it took them three days [to see in the past] because of travel,” he added.",
            "A major reason for improved productivity is that people have had little else to do during the shelter-at-home directive and felt pressure to produce to retain their jobs, countered Shane Metcalf, chief culture officer at 15Five, an enterprise technology company.",
            "“One of the shadow side effects is that employees are working longer hours, and feel as if they’re always on call,” he said. “They are stressed.”",
            "See also: Cisco profit continues to flow amid pandemic despite revenue slowdown",
            "To be sure, not everyone will follow Twitter’s lead. Some, like Apple Inc. AAPL, +0.64%, Nvidia Corp. NVDA, +2.86% and Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, -0.40%, have devoted billions of dollars to sparkling new facilities that will always house thousands of employees. And some people want to return to an office, pointed out PagerDuty’s Tejada.",
            "Added Butterfield: “Some employees are going insane [because they] are cooped up alone in an apartment or have kids and want to go back to work. The majority want to be in the office.”",
            "“We don’t believe that ‘office-less globally’ is in our company’s best interest to build strong company culture or long-term productivity. Like most things in life, the best answer is typically something that moderates between two extremes,” Vonage Holdings Corp. VG, +1.84% CEO Alan Masarek told MarketWatch via email. None of the company’s 2,400 employees will be required to come back to the office “until they are comfortable doing so.”",
            "Record traffic usage of Zoom, Microsoft Corp.’s MSFT, +0.04% Teams, Slack Technologies Inc.’s WORK, +0.22% enterprise messaging, Cisco Systems Inc.’s CSCO, +0.58% Webex and other services underscores the always-on workplace.",
            "“Some elements of this work-from-home scenario will not go away,” Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins said during a conference call with analysts Wednesday following the company’s quarterly earnings announcement. For example, Webex hosted more than 20 billion meeting minutes in April, compared with 14 billion in March and 7 billion in February.",
            "“The pandemic has created a permanent shift in the way people are working, and while not every organization will go 100% work from home forever, there will certainly be more support for virtualized environments,” Masarek said.",
            "One company going all-in virtually is Dialpad because, quite simply, it can. CEO Craig Walker, who helped develop Google Voice technology, was leaning that way before the pandemic forced most of the economy to shut down. He wants the communications-software firm’s 400 employees to work from home four or five days a week, he said, and he plans to halve office space to accommodate a staggered work schedule.",
            "No matter what path companies take, they agree it will not be the same. Some employees will exclusively work from home, while others will opt for the office. And others may do both.",
            "“It’s back to a whole new way of work — like back to the future,” says Quick Base CEO Ed Jennings, who took over the $1 billion, 500-person company this week, but has yet to visit headquarters.",
            "Still, he’s already re-imagining what it will look like in the future — with more open space, partitions and collaboration spaces.",
            "“It is hard to create depth of relationship when you communicate strictly via virtual meeting,” Jennings said. “Employees say these days they get things done so much faster at home. The question is whether that is sustainable.”"

Value’s opposite is growth: Stocks in this latter category typically trade for high valuation ratios.",
            "I’m not kidding when I say that value investing takes guts. According to a recent analysis from Research Affiliates, value has lagged growth now for more than 13 years — the longest stretch in recorded U.S. market history. This has led to a seemingly-endless series of pronouncements in recent years that value investing is dead.",

Their average price/book ratio is 26% lower, and their average price/sales ratio is 10% lower. (See chart below.) And given their status as value stocks, it is not a surprise that they have been lagging of late.",
            "The newsletters recommending these four stocks have excellent long-term performance. I calculate that, over the last 20 years (through April 2020) they have outperformed the S&P 500 by 3.2 percentage points annualized.

Their current struggles give investors a chance to buy good-quality stocks at a discount.",
            "This is, and always has been, the classic refrain of the value investor, of course. Is there reason to believe that the newsletters’ faith in these stocks will be rewarded, even though value has lagged for the last 13+ years? Yes, and one reason is these newsletters’ excellent long-term records.",
            "Another is what was found by the Research Affiliates study mentioned above, which was authored by Rob Arnott, the firm’s founder; Campbell Harvey, a finance professor at Duke University; Vitali Kalesnik, a senior member of Research Affiliates’ investment team, and Juhani Linnainmaa, a finance professor at Dartmouth College. They subjected to statistical scrutiny all the explanations they were aware of for why value has lagged growth for so long, including:",

            "While beaches on Long Island or in New Jersey are usually reached by driving, city residents typically take the subway to summertime destinations like Coney Island or Rockaway Beach.",
            "Under guidelines intended to keep crowds from flocking to the beaches, people who live nearby can go there to walk or to sit, de Blasio said. Hundreds of police officers and civilian city workers will be on hand to disperse gatherings that violate social distancing rules and to hand out masks to people who aren’t wearing them, he said.",
            "“I’m very hopeful that this weekend at our beaches, you’re going to see people following the rules because they know it’s the right thing to do,” de Blasio said. “But if they need some reminders, of course there’ll be people out there educating, giving out face coverings.”",
            "While most of New York state has begun to ease restrictions, de Blasio and Cuomo, both Democrats, have said that New York City, the epicenter of the virus outbreak in the United States, is still weeks away from starting to reopen."

            "Last week I wrote that this was the end of the Warren Buffett era as Berkshire BRK.A, +0.45% BRK.B, -0.00% underperformed the S&P 500 SPX, +0.23% over the entire 2009-2020 bear market. Even Buffett himself recommends investors buy the S&P.",
            "Many Buffett fans responded by saying don’t count Buffett out yet because when (not if) the market tanks again, he’ll have more than $130 billion in cash to scoop up bargains. My MarketWatch colleague Mark Hulbert noted that top advisers often come back from losing streaks to post big gains.",
            "So, what have the nearly 90-year-old Buffett and his 96-year-old business partner Charlie Munger done for us lately? Based on Berkshire’s SEC filings, three of Buffett’s biggest recent investments—Kraft Heinz KHC, +0.80% , Occidental Petroleum OXY, -0.84% , and airline stocks—have lost at least $7 billion altogether out of an investment of roughly $10 billion in each.",
            "To my knowledge, this is the first time anyone has reported that figure. (Berkshire did not respond to my emailed questions by deadline.)",
            "In 2013 Berkshire and private equity firm 3G Capital paid $23.2 billion to buy H.J. Heinz Co., and two years later Heinz bought Kraft Foods Group for $54 billion. Kraft Heinz Co. stock moved closely with the S&P for a couple of years. Then, after hitting an all-time closing high above $93 in February 2017, it began a long decline.",
            "Last year Berkshire wrote down its investment by $3 billion, while Kraft Heinz took a $15 billion write-off on its Kraft and Oscar Mayer brands. In February, even before the market selloff began, Fitch Ratings and S&P Global Ratings downgraded Kraft Heinz to junk status. Meanwhile, in 2018 and 2019, 3G sold millions of shares (it still has a big stake) as Berkshire held firm. As of March 31, Berkshire’s Kraft Heinz shares were worth about $8 billion, around $2 billion less than what it paid for them.",
            "When the deal was struck, The New York Times called it “a big bet on conventional staples of the American cupboard, even as consumers are shifting away from processed foods.”",
            "Millennials just aren’t in to the iconic brands Buffett enjoyed as a boy.",
            "“I made a mistake in the Kraft purchase in terms of paying too much,” Buffett told CNBC last June. No kidding.",
            "Just two months later, in August, Berkshire completed a $10 billion investment in Occidental Petroleum, which helped Oxy win a bidding war against oil giant Chevron CHV, +1.12% to buy Anadarko Petroleum for $38 billion. The deal made Occidental the biggest player in the U.S.’s Permian Basin, the world’s highest producing oilfield.",
            "Berkshire got 100,000 preferred shares, which gave it first dibs on dividend payments if things went south. That’s exactly what happened less than six months later. After the recent collapse in crude, Occidental cut dividends on its common stock by 86%. But it still owes Berkshire a hefty 8% annual dividend on the preferred shares, which Occidental has paid out in depreciated common stock rather than cash.",
            "On Wednesday, Occidental common shares changed hands below $15, about one third the $44 a share at which it traded when the deal closed. As of March 31, Berkshire had lost about $500 million on the common stock it owned, but the April dividend payment doubled Berkshire’s common share holdings, cutting its paper loss in half.",
            "We couldn’t determine a current price for the preferred shares of Occidental, which don’t trade regularly. The accumulation of those preferred dividends over time, whether in cash or common stock, could soften the blow of an investment that at best looks like a masterpiece of bad timing.",
            "And then there were the airlines. From mid-2016 through early 2017, Berkshire bought tens of millions of shares in the four largest U.S.-based carriers—American Airlines Group AAL, -1.92% , Delta Air Lines DAL, -2.02% , Southwest Airlines LUV, -2.46% , and United Airlines UAL, -1.70%",
            "The price tag was north of $9.3 billion, by my calculations.",
            "But when coronavirus hit, airline stocks plummeted, and by the time Berkshire dumped them all in April, they were worth about $4.3 billion, assuming all shares were sold on the SEC filing dates. That amounts to a stratospheric loss of $5 billion. Add all these losses together and you have at least a $7 billion hit to Berkshire, not including any decline in value on the Oxy preferred shares it owns.",
            "Buffett has had some bad luck. Who could have foreseen COVID-19? But the problems with Occidental happened soon after the deal closed and there have been big clouds hanging over energy stocks for years. Buffett also waited until April to dump airline stocks, near the bottom.",
            "Even more troubling, after he bought a stake in USAir in 1989, he complained the investment had “soured before the ink dried on the check.”",
            "“Investors have regularly poured money into the domestic airline business to finance profitless (or worse) growth,” he wrote to shareholders in 1992.",
            "As recently as 2007, he noted that “a durable competitive advantage [in the airline industry] has proven elusive ever since the days of the Wright brothers.” Even in 2013, he called airlines “a death trap for investors.”",
            "So, he didn’t heed his own warnings, then went out and bought not one airline, but four? After all these mishaps and losses, who would want to bet a single share of Berkshire Hathaway stock that Warren Buffett is going to return to his former glory?"

            "This coronavirus survivor hopes a picture is worth a thousand warnings.",
            "San Francisco nurse Mike Schultz has gone viral for sharing a shocking before-and-after split image that shows the physical toll that the coronavirus took on his formerly healthy body.",
            "The image on the left, taken before he was hospitalized with COVID-19, shows the ripped RN with his shirt off. Before getting sick, he told Buzzfeed News that he weighed around 190 pounds and worked out six or seven days a week. The one on the right was taken after he spent a month and a half being sedated and intubated on a ventilator. He’s almost unrecognizable in this one, and down to 140 pounds, he said.",
            "“I wanted to show everyone how badly being sedated for 6 weeks on a ventilator or intubated can be,” Schultz, 43, wrote in an Instagram FB, +1.52% post. See it here:",
            "",
            "Schultz told Buzzfeed that he had no underlying health conditions. So before getting sick, he didn’t think that COVID-19 was a serious risk for him, in line with early, erroneous beliefs that the novel coronavirus was sickening the elderly and those with underlying conditions, and sparing younger, healthier persons. Indeed, we know now that even young children are being afflicted by the virus and a puzzling multisystem inflammatory syndrome that appears related to the virus.",
            "“I thought I was young enough for it not to affect me, and I know a lot of people think that,” he said.",
            "Schultz had attended the Winter Party Festival in Miami Beach with his boyfriend, Josh Hebblethwaite, in early March. At least 38 people who attended the bash subsequently developed COVID-19, the Miami Herald reported, and three men died.",
            "Within a few days of flying to Hebblethwaite’s home in Boston after the party, however, both men started feeling sick. Schultz’s fever spiked to 103, and he had difficulty breathing. He was admitted to the hospital in Boston on March 16, and transferred to a bigger hospital four days later. He developed pneumonia, and was sedated and intubated for four and a half weeks.",
            "But he was so out-of-it from being sedated and intubated that, “I thought only a week had gone by” when he woke up, he said. And he was so weak at first that he couldn’t even hold his cellphone.",
            "His recovery has been slow and steady as he works to rebuild his lung capacity to its original strength. The good news is, he revealed in another Instagram post on May 14 that he has been released after spending 57 days in the hospital, and is recovering at home with his boyfriend.",
            "",
            "As for the viral photo he shared that was topping Reddit on Wednesday and had been “liked” more than 20,000 times on Instagram, “I wanted to show it can happen to anyone,” he said. “It doesn’t matter if you’re young or old, have preexisting conditions or not. It can affect you.”",
            "More than 4.9 million people have tested positive for COVID-19 around the world, and at least 325,650 people have died, according to the latest data. The United States continues to have the highest case count and death toll, with 1.54 million confirmed cases and 92,387 casualties.",

            "It all started with the dream of growing a rose on Mars.",
            "That vision, Elon Musk’s vision, morphed into a shake-up of the old space industry, and a fleet of new private rockets.",
            "Now, those rockets will launch NASA astronauts from Florida to the International Space Station -- the first time a for-profit company will carry astronauts into the cosmos.",
            "President Donald Trump plans to be on the Florida coast Wednesday to watch American astronauts blast into orbit from the Kennedy Space Center for the first time in nearly a decade.",
            "It will be the first time since the space shuttle program ended in 2011 that U.S. astronauts will launch into space aboard an American rocket from American soil.",
            "Elon Musk’s SpaceX is the conductor and NASA the customer as businesses begin chauffeuring astronauts to the International Space Station. With American shuttles no longer in use, the United States has had to rely on Russia for rides to the station.",
            "The NASA/SpaceX Commercial Crew flight test launch will carry NASA’s newest test pilots, Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken, in a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket.",
            "They’re scheduled to blast off at 4:33 p.m. EDT from launch pad 39A, the same one the Apollo astronauts used to get to the moon.",
            "The shift to private companies allows NASA to zero in on deep space travel. The space agency is working to return astronauts to the moon by 2024 under orders from the White House, but that deadline appears increasingly unlikely even as three newly chosen commercial teams rush to develop lunar landers. Mars also beckons.",
            "The White House portrayed the launch as an extension of Trump’s promise to reassert American dominance in space. He recently oversaw creation of the Space Force as the sixth branch of the armed forces.",
            "“Our destiny, beyond the Earth, is not only a matter of national identity, but a matter of national security,” Trump said in a statement.",
            "Vice President Mike Pence, who is chairman of the National Space Council, also plans to attend Wednesday’s launch.",
            "NASA has discouraged spectators, citing the pandemic, and is limiting the number of visitors inside the space center.",
            "It’s a milestone in the effort to commercialize space. But for Musk’s company, SpaceX, it’s also the latest milestone in a wild ride that began with epic failures and the threat of bankruptcy.",
            "If the company’s eccentric founder and CEO has his way, this is just the beginning: He’s planning to build a city on the red planet Mars, and live there.",
            "“What I really want to achieve here is to make Mars seem possible, make it seem as though it’s something that we can do in our lifetimes and that you can go,” Musk told a cheering congress of space professionals in Mexico in 2016.",
            "Musk “is a revolutionary change” in the space world, says Harvard University astrophysicist Jonathan McDowell, whose Jonathan’s Space Report has tracked launches and failures for decades.",
            "Ex-astronaut and former Commercial Spaceflight Federation chief Michael Lopez-Alegria says, “I think history will look back at him like a da Vinci figure.”",
            "Musk has become best known for Tesla, his audacious effort to build an electric vehicle company. But SpaceX predates it.",
            "At 30, Musk was already wildly rich from selling his internet financial company PayPal and its predecessor Zip2. He arranged a series of lunches in Silicon Valley in 2001 with G. Scott Hubbard, who had been NASA’s Mars czar and was then running the agency’s Ames Research Center.",
            "Musk wanted to somehow grow a rose on the red planet, show it to the world and inspire school children, recalls Hubbard.",
            "“His real focus was having life on Mars,” says Hubbard, a Stanford University professor who now chairs SpaceX’s crew safety advisory panel.",
            "The big problem, Hubbard told him, was building a rocket affordable enough to go to Mars. Less than a year later Space Exploration Technologies, called SpaceX, was born.",
            "There are many space companies and like all of them, SpaceX is designed for profit. But what’s different is that behind that profit motive is a goal, which is simply to “Get Elon to Mars,” McDowell says. “By having that longer-term vision, that’s pushed them to be more ambitious and really changed things.”",
            "Everyone at SpaceX, from senior vice presidents to the barista who offers its in-house cappuccinos and FroYo, “will tell you they are working to make humans multi-planetary,” says former SpaceX Director of Space Operations Garrett Reisman, an ex-astronaut now at the University of Southern California.",
            "Musk founded the company just before NASA ramped up the notion of commercial space.",
            "Traditionally, private firms built things or provided services for NASA, which remained the boss and owned the equipment. The idea of bigger roles for private companies has been around for more than 50 years, but the market and technology weren’t yet right.",
            "NASA’s two deadly space shuttle accidents -- Challenger in 1986 and Columbia in 2003 -- were pivotal, says W. Henry Lambright, a professor of public policy at Syracuse University.",
            "When Columbia disintegrated, NASA had to contemplate a post-space shuttle world. That’s where private companies came in, Lambright says.",
            "After Columbia, the agency focused on returning astronauts to the moon, but still had to get cargo and astronauts to the space station, says Sean O’Keefe, who was NASA’s administrator at the time. A 2005 pilot project helped private companies develop ships to bring cargo to the station.",
            "SpaceX got some of that initial funding. The company’s first three launches failed. The company could have just as easily failed too, but NASA stuck by SpaceX and it started to pay off, Lambright says.",
            "“You can’t explain SpaceX without really understanding how NASA really kind of nurtured it in the early days,” Lambright says. “In a way, SpaceX is kind of a child of NASA.”",
            "Since 2010, NASA has spent $6 billion to help private companies get people into orbit, with SpaceX and Boeing the biggest recipients, says Phil McAlister, NASA’s commercial spaceflight director.",
            "NASA plans to spend another $2.5 billion to purchase 48 astronaut seats to the space station in 12 different flights, he says. At a little more than $50 million a ride, it’s much cheaper than what NASA has paid Russia for flights to the station.",
            "Starting from scratch has given SpaceX an advantage over older firms and NASA that are stuck using legacy technology and infrastructure, O’Keefe says.",
            "And SpaceX tries to build everything itself, giving the firm more control, Reisman says. The company saves money by reusing rockets, and it has customers aside from NASA.",
            "The California company now has 6,000 employees. Its workers are young, highly caffeinated and put in 60- to 90-hour weeks, Hubbard and Reisman say. They also embrace risk more than their NASA counterparts.",
            "Decisions that can take a year at NASA can be made in one or two meetings at SpaceX, says Reisman, who still advises the firm.",
            "In 2010, a Falcon 9 rocket on the launch pad had a cracked nozzle extension on an engine. Normally that would mean rolling the rocket off the pad and a fix that would delay launch more than a month.",
            "But with NASA’s permission, SpaceX engineer Florence Li was hoisted into the rocket nozzle with a crane and harness. Then, using what were essentially garden shears, she “cut the thing, we launched the next day and it worked,” Reisman says.",
            "Musk is SpaceX’s public and unconventional face -- smoking marijuana on a popular podcast, feuding with local officials about opening his Tesla plant during the pandemic, naming his newborn child “X Æ A-12.” But insiders say aerospace industry veteran Gwynne Shotwell, the president and chief operating officer, is also key to the company’s success.",
            "“The SpaceX way is actually a combination of Musk’s imagination and creativity and drive and Shotwell’s sound management and responsible engineering,” McDowell says.",
            "But it all comes back to Musk’s dream. Former NASA chief O’Keefe says Musk has his eccentricities, huge doses of self-confidence and persistence, and that last part is key: “You have the capacity to get through a setback and look ... toward where you’re trying to go.”",
            "For Musk, it’s Mars.",

            "This chart compares the Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF DIA, -0.05% to seven stocks that I am using to illustrate shifts in money flows.",
            "Note the following:",
            "• Zoom Video ZM, -0.56% has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of coronavirus. As the chart shows, the stock is up about 140% year to date. As the economy is now opening up and there is the prospect of a vaccine emerging sooner than expected, the price of Zoom Video is beginning to roll over. We believe the smart money flows in the stock are now negative.",
            "Zoom Video has gained a lot of free customers. In our analysis, it will have difficulty converting those free customers into paying customers. It also faces stiff competition, has experienced security issues and has an unattractive stock valuation. For these reasons, the stock should be sold. The Arora Report has recently taken a short position in Zoom Video.",

            "Also:Zoom acquires Keybase as it seeks to boost security efforts",
            "• Smart money flows in Peloton Interactive PTON, +1.12% also are negative. Peloton has benefited from people staying at home and the closing of gyms. The company reported very strong earnings and recently reached a milestone of 1 million connected users. I believe it will continue to grow. However the present valuation is unattractive and the positive sentiment behind the stock may not stay as positive as the economy opens.",
            "The Arora Report has taken profits on most of its Peloton position and is now exiting the remaining position.",
            "• Smart money flows in Teladoc Health TDOC, -0.46% also are negative. Teladoc has benefited from the shift to telemedicine during the coronavirus shutdown. Some of these benefits will persist as the economy opens up but as the chart shows, the stock price is rolling over. The present high valuation is not likely to be sustained. The Arora Report previously took profits on its Teladoc position.",
            "• Smart money flows also are negative in Slack Technologies WORK, +0.22%. Slack faces stiff competition from Microsoft’s MSFT, +0.04% Team product. The present positive sentiment toward the stock is not sustainable and the stock should be on a sell list. The Arora Report doesn’t have a position in Slack; however it does own shares in Microsoft.",
            "• Smart money flows are positive in Walmart WMT, -0.52% and mildly negative in Amazon AMZN, -0.40%, two other companies that have benefited from coronavirus. As the chart shows, Walmart and Amazon stocks are not rolling over. Walmart has reported earnings better than the consensus and the whisper numbers. The gains that Walmart has experienced are sustainable. The valuation is rich but justifiable. The Arora Report has long-term positions in both Walmart and Amazon.",
            "• Smart money flows also are positive in Disney DIS, +0.16%. The company has been hurt by the coronavirus but money is now flowing into the stock. As the chart shows, the stock price is moving higher. The Arora Report bought Disney when the stock fell into our buy zone in March.",
            "The intra-market shifts in money flows described above are a positive sign for the stock market because they indicate a shift from stocks which are likely to have decelerating momentum of earnings to accelerating momentum of earnings. The emphasis here is on “momentum of earnings” and not just earnings.",
            "As a note of caution, this does not mean that investors should necessarily rush out and buy stocks. From a technical perspective the stock market is very overbought and vulnerable to a pullback unless the second leg of the short squeeze starts.",
            "I extensively use the technique of trade-around positions — shorter-term positions that surround the core positions, which in turn are partially hedged. Investors should consider separating out strategic decisions from tactical decisions and also short-term trades from long-term investments.",

            "June will see the final seasons of the ’90s revival comedy “Fuller House” (June 2), as well as the teen drama “13 Reasons Why” (June 5). Ryan Murphy’s dark election comedy “The Politician” (June 19) returns for a second season, “Queer Eye” (June 5) moves to Philadelphia for its fifth season of makeovers, the Peabody Award-winning comedy/news-analysis show “Patriot Act with Hasan Minaj” (June 7) is back for a sixth season, and the understated and sweet dating show “Dating Around” (June 12) returns for a second season, this time set in New Orleans.",
            "The highlight of the month for Netflix NFLX, -1.58% may be Spike Lee’s first direct-to-streaming film, “Da 5 Bloods” (June 12), as four African-American Vietnam vets return to that country in search of a fallen comrade’s body — and a stash of gold. On the lighter side, there’s also “Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga” (June 26), a musical mocumentary starring Will Ferrell and Rachel McAdams as an Icelandic singing duo.",
            "Other potentially intriguing offerings include the spelling-bee documentary “Spelling the Dream” (June 3), the medical documentary set at a New York City hospital “Lenox Hill” (June 10) and the ridiculous game show “Floor Is Lava” (June 19), where teams navigate a room without touching the floor because, you guessed it — the floor is lava.",

            "He used this chart to show how the typically red-hot Bay Area housing market, including Marin, Sonoma, Napa and Solano counties, has been grinding to a halt.",
            "“This is supposed to be the spring selling season, and new listings are supposed to surge,” Richter explained in a post. “But sellers aren’t interested in having potentially infected people traipsing through their home; and they know that buyers are woefully absent, and it doesn’t make that much sense to list the home because previously listed homes are still languishing on the market.”",
            "Here’s a chart of what the trend typically looks like vs. the current reality:",
            "According to Thomas Stone, a Sonoma Country realtor quoted on the Wolf Street blog, there’s a very rough road ahead in the housing sector due to falling appraisals, a trickier loan market and a glut of vacation rentals that owners need to shed.",
            "“The next big shoe to drop will be when appraisers call a declining market, probably in August but perhaps as early as July,” he said. “And this bleeds into the difficulties of getting a mortgage.”",
            "A new report from Oxford Economics estimates that 15% of homeowners will fall behind on their monthly mortgage payments, which would mean delinquencies caused by the coronavirus pandemic would exceed the number seen during the Great Recession.",
            "“The uncertainty in the mortgage market has contributed to a significant tightening of lending standards that may persist even once a recovery is underway,” Oxford Economics wrote.",
            "Then there’s the big number of vacation rental houses in a completely dead Wine Country market — who’s planning trips this summer? — that may also provide a stiff headwind to the recovery.",
            "“So there you have it,” Richter said, putting an exclamation point on his dire forecast. “A most splendid housing bubble and an equally splendid vacation-rental boom that were both caught at the peak in their most vulnerable state by The Virus that upended everything.”",
            "The stock market has certainly been upended, with Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.03% heading toward another rough session on Thursday. The S&P 500 SPX, +0.23% and Nasdaq Composite COMP, +0.42% were also poised to move lower."

            "My father had plenty of habits that irritated my mother. But nothing irritated her more than “Marty being cheap.” As a child, I didn’t understand it either.",
            "For instance, my father turned off the lights in rooms that people had just left. Sometimes we were leaving just to come right back in, but whenever he was home, he would march across the little hallway from wherever he was at either end of the house to click the light switches down. Did he like a dark house?",
            "With the lights off, the forest-green end of the house was as dismal as a real Hansel and Gretel woods. My mother would march right back from wherever she had been to defiantly flick the switches up.",
            "My father also saved things. He wore the same plaid flannel shirts year after year, one on top of another, even indoors. In the basement shop, when I was invited, he took long, thick crooked nails that had been pulled out of boards with the claw end of the hammer and smashed them with the fat butt end, so they straightened out like new.",
            "He saved rusted nails, which had turned a delicate copper color I liked. Each size went into its own unmatched little glass jar: screws, screw-eyes, all the iron nails: the tenpenny, brads, roofing nails, slender white finish nails and even some upholstery nails with stubby shanks hidden by golden curving indented tops.",
            "But the frugal habit my mother mocked most was my father’s taking the little bitty soap ends and mashing them together so they made a small irregular cake or many-sided oily squashed muffin.",
            "He didn’t explain to me why he was doing any of those things. He didn’t explain anything, except, rarely, American politics. He was a silent man.",
            "Maybe in those days, my mother flattened him. But she was a good mother to me, and you don’t judge your parents when you are still so young it’s difficult to tell them apart. Later, when I was married, they came to visit to say they were a happy couple now. My mother, as it were, apologized. She said gaily, because it was all in the past, “I didn’t let him be the captain of his own ship.” They had a good year before he got sick with ALS.",
            "As an adult, I used to tell friends those amusing childhood stories about my freaky father — straightening bent nails, turning lights off, saving soap ends. People recognized he did those things to save money.",
            "In the middle class, where my husband and I had slowly risen to occupy a fairly secure place, saving money had begun to seem odd. It was “cheap,” just as my upwardly mobile mother had said, even before the postwar boom really got started lifting our boat.",
            "My generation’s goal, as we were moving up economic ladders, was to spend on visible objects, showing taste as well as means.",
            "Also read: How to enjoy a frugal retirement",
            "But over time, I noticed that as I told the stories, they had lost the tinge of being amusing foibles. They began to edge toward being about thrift. Conspicuous consumption had seemed cruelly elite during the Great Depression, which marked both my parents, though in opposite ways. ",
            "Likewise, after the Great Recession of 2008, waste of any kind began to seem excessive, ostentatious, brutal and stupid. Saving became not a mere trend, but a value and a virtue of those who could manage it. The planet cannot take the rapid, steady diminution of its resources forever.",
            "Plenty of people are replicating some of my dad’s frugal habits. Anyone with any sense now wants to save electricity, because so much of it still comes from fossil fuels. Everyone goes around smoothing down the dimmers.",
            "I’ve come to see differently what I once thought of as my father’s eccentricities. I’ve come closer to him in spirit.",
            "Since he gave me his jars, my own basement shop has held his nail collection and I draw on the legacy.",
            "See: The road to riches is this simple: Drive a crappy car",
            "Just recently, when I mentioned the soap ends, a close friend said with a smile that was only slightly embarrassed: “How do you do that?”",
            "“Oh, it’s quick and easy,” I began. “You get a few slivers wet and soft and slimy and you crush them and press them and rub them around until they hold together. It feels so nice.”",
            "Margaret Morganroth Gullette, a resident scholar in Women’s Studies at Brandeis University, is the author of the prizewinning book, “Ending Ageism, or How Not to Shoot Old People.” Her essays are often cited as notable in Best American Essays, most recently in 2018, 2016 and 2015.",

            "A new study of California coronavirus patients adds to a burgeoning body of evidence that the virus disproportionately impacts racial and ethnic minorities.",
            "African-American COVID-19 patients have 2.7 times the odds of being admitted to the hospital compared to non-Hispanic white patients after controlling for sex, age, income and co-morbid health conditions, according to a study in the journal Health Affairs conducted by researchers affiliated with Sutter Health, a nonprofit health system in northern California.",
            "The researchers, who analyzed 1,052 confirmed coronavirus cases between Jan. 1 and April 8, said there could be a number of potential explanations for this gap, including that African-American patients might have “more advanced or severe illness at the time of presenting for COVID-19 testing and medical care.”",
            "“One hypothesis is that there may be some unknown or unmeasured genetic or biological factors that increase the severity of this illness for African Americans,” they wrote. “Another possibility is that our results are explained by societal factors that either result in barriers to timely access to care, or create circumstances in which patients view delaying care as the most sensible option.”",
            "“ ‘Our findings suggest that the greatest risk, in terms of hospitalization, is borne by the African American community. This pandemic offers the opportunity to identify and quantify these inequities, and to seek solutions.’ ”",
            "Health-care providers’ unconscious biases and patients’ negative health-care experiences in the past could also result in a lack of trust and “the decision to seek care only in the most extreme circumstances,” they wrote.",
            "“This has been documented in health-care settings across the U.S. and remains a major threat to health equity,” the authors wrote. “Presentation and testing in the [emergency department] and hospital may indicate that African Americans seek care at a later stage, leading to the higher rates of admissions.”",
            "Several previous studies have suggested that black and Hispanic Americans bear a disproportionate share of COVID-19 illness and death. President Trump said last month that black Americans were “getting hit very, very hard” by the disease.",
            "“This is a real problem and it is showing up very strongly in our data on the African-American community,” he said during a coronavirus briefing.",
            "An Associated Press analysis last month of COVID-19 cases and deaths across the country found that among victims whose demographic data was available, 42% were black — while black people made up just 21% of the analyzed areas’ total population. The report noted that historic inequities in health-care access and economic conditions, as well as institutional racism, had increased black Americans’ susceptibility to the coronavirus.",
            "Racial and ethnic minorities are also overrepresented in essential jobs that require them to commute to work outside the home, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention pointed out. They are more likely to have underlying health conditions that might make them more vulnerable to severe cases of the disease, and less likely to have health insurance.",
            "“The experience of Sutter Health highlights the fact that race and ethnicity play a pivotal role in determining how and when care is accessed, and the outcome,” the Health Affairs article said. “Our findings suggest that the greatest risk, in terms of hospitalization, is borne by the African American community. This pandemic offers the opportunity to identify and quantify these inequities, and to seek solutions.”"

            "Dear Moneyist,",
            "I was married and didn’t qualify for the $1,200 stimulus check based on my 2018 tax returns. I am now divorced and filed my 2019 tax returns separately. It seems that millions of stimulus payments have already gone out. Where is my stimulus check? Will I ever receive one — or is it too late?",
            "I didn’t qualify under my 2018 taxes, but I DO qualify under my 2019 taxes. I filed about 10 days after the traditional filing date, so I missed the first round. If there is a second round of stimulus checks, will the Internal Revenue Service give me a check based on my 2019 return?",
            "Shaquanna",
            "Dispatches from a pandemic: Letter from New York: ‘New Yorkers wear colorful homemade masks, while nurses wear garbage bags’",
            "Dear Shaquanna,",
            "Your economic impact payment is effectively an advance on a 2020 tax credit, so you should receive a stimulus payment of up to $1,200, but it won’t arrive until next year, unfortunately. Some 130 million checks have already been sent out, and millions more people are awaiting their checks. The IRS will send $1,200 payments to individuals with adjusted gross annual income below $75,000, and $2,400 to married couples filing taxes jointly who earn under $150,000.",
            "“ ‘Eligible taxpayers who received a smaller-than-expected economic impact payment may qualify to receive an additional amount early next year.’ ”",
            "“In many instances, eligible taxpayers who received a smaller-than-expected economic impact payment may qualify to receive an additional amount early next year when they file their 2020 federal income tax return,” the IRS said. “EIPs are technically an advance payment of a new temporary tax credit that eligible taxpayers can claim on their 2020 return. Everyone should keep for their records the letter they receive by mail within a few weeks after their payment is issued.”",
            "If the IRS doesn’t have a taxpayer’s direct-deposit information on file, the agency will mail checks, but those checks mailed out after a deadline last Wednesday would arrive by late May at the earliest, the agency said. You can submit your bank-account and address information through the IRS tracking tool, “Get My Payment.” It should also tell you if the IRS needs more bank-account information. Having your bank details on file will help speed the plow for a payment next year.",
            "Don’t miss:‘We will not have a vaccine by next winter.’ Like the 1918 Spanish flu, CDC says second wave of coronavirus could be worse. So what happens now?",
            "I receive hundreds of emails every week from people who have not received their stimulus check. Some were listed as dependents on their parents’ tax returns, which rules them out of receiving a payment this year; others do qualify yet wonder why they have not received a payment. If the IRS does not have your bank-account information on file, it will likely take longer. Approximately 14 million Americans don’t have bank accounts or 6.5% of U.S. households.",
            "Also see: I received my ex-husband’s $1,200 stimulus check because we filed joint taxes in 2018. Should I give him the money or return it to the IRS?",
            "Immigration status also plays a role. The government is paying American citizens, and some non–U.S. citizens, including “legal permanent residents” or green-card holders, according to the IRS. Marriage to a green-card holder does not necessarily mean a second stimulus check, lawyers say. Others have had their stimulus checks garnished due to unpaid child-support payments. If you are behind on student loans, however, that will not impact your payment.",
            "The Moneyist: My son is staying with me, yet my financially irresponsible ex-husband received his $500 stimulus check. Is my ex right to keep it?",
            "The White House is mulling a second round of payments, two senior administrative officials told CNBC earlier this month CMCS, +2.87% CMCSA, -0.53%. The White House released a statement in response to that report: “As President Trump has said, we are going to ensure that we take care of all Americans so that we emerge from this challenge healthy, stronger, and with economic prosperity, which is why the White House is focused on pro-growth, middle class tax and regulatory relief.”",

            "“As we’ve become accustomed to working outside the office, it’s become clear that we don’t need everyone to be physically present to do great work,” Lori Goler, vice president of people at Facebook said in a post on Thursday “From now on, we are moving toward making remote work a more permanent part of our culture.”",
            "Shopify SHOP, +2.84% Chief Executive Tobi Lutke echoed Facebook’s FB, +1.52% announcement tweeting later that day that “office centricity is over” and most workers should expect to permanently work from home well after the pandemic.",
            "Twitter, however, was the first major company to announce a permanent work-from-home option. “Opening offices will be our decision, when and if our employees come back, will be theirs,” states a Twitter post from May 12.",
            "The work-from-home options may not be applicable to or, indeed, welcomed by all workers. If you work at Facebook and you move to a cheaper city you may have to take a pay cut, CEO Mark Zuckerberg told employees on Thursday.",
            "For instance, roles related to office security or in-office operations can only be performed in the office, a Square SQ, spokeswoman told MarketWatch. Similarly, a Twitter spokeswoman said that employees who work in data centers won’t be able to work remotely once it is safe for them to return to work.",
            "Other companies like Google GOOG, +0.54% GOOGL, +0.46%, Visa V, +0.12% and American Express AXP, -0.55% have gone ahead and told workers they continue to be working from home well into next year. There’s no word on whether they will allow workers to permanently work from home.",
            "“Visa continues to closely monitor COVID-19 and its impact globally, while prioritizing the health and well-being of our employees,” said Will Stickney, a Visa spokesman. “As a result, we expect a majority of Visa’s workforce will continue to work from home through the 2020 calendar year.”",

            "Don’t miss:‘I was told I could never work remotely’: Before coronavirus, workers with disabilities say they implored employers to allow them to work from home",
            "Certainly, there are benefits to working from home — you don’t have to worry about getting caught in traffic and showing up late to a meeting. Perhaps your coworker who leaves the office microwave a mess or who tries to walk over others to get ahead will no longer come into the office.",
            "But that decision may come with some significant costs. Consider these pros and cons:",
            "Depending on what state you’re from, you could spend between $2,000 and $5,000 a year on commuting, according to calculations by Business Insider based on data from the U.S. Census Bureau. You could also save you a total of 9.4 days a year from the time spent commuting, according to an May survey of nearly 3,000 American workers published by Global Workplace Analytics, a San Diego-based workplace consultancy firm.",
            "That means you could wake up later, spend less on gasoline, said Kate Lister, president of Global Workplace Analytics. It may even make sense to get rid of your car altogether, she said. Lister said she sold her car after she began working from home years before coronavirus. She now shares one car with her husband. (To calculate the total amount of money you could save by teleworking check out this employee savings calculator)",
            "Employees at Square and Facebook may not be compensated for work-related costs if they choose to work from home on a daily basis. (Both companies declined to comment.) Twitter TWTR, +0.86% employees, however, will be compensated for the cost of Wi-Fi and receive a stipend for their at-home office setup, a spokeswoman said.",
            "“The costs of potentially upgrading to speedier Wi-Fi, acquiring office supplies and setting up an ergonomic-friendly workspace could add up if your employer is unable to offer additional financial support,” said Sarah Stoddard, a Glassdoor career trends expert. But the amount you’re saving on commuting should make up for that cost, Lister added.",
            "Typically non-remote workers live in areas close to where they work. That often means a high cost of living, especially in cities like New York or San Francisco. Even if you still plan on going into your office once a week, an hour drive may not be all the bad when you factor in how much you could save, Lister said. Your company, like Facebook, may insist you take a pay cut to compensate for that.",

            "If you’re teleworking, it may be harder for you to impress your boss, which may mean losing out on a promotion, Stoddard said. But you can find new ways to demonstrate your involvement and impact at work if you choose to permanently work from home. “Even minor tactics like turning on your video during virtual meetings, providing an additional perspective in email threads and delivering timely status reports to your manager can go a long way,” she said.",
            "Research shows that socialization at work can lead to a less stressful work environment. By working from home you may miss out on happy hours, birthday celebrations and casual one-on-one lunches with coworkers. There’s also a lot to be said for office banter and brainstorming over the water cooler, workplace consultants say, and you would be saved from the seemingly endless deluge of daily Slack WORK, +0.22% messages."

            "SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — San Francisco is joining other U.S. cities in authorizing homeless-tent encampments in response to the coronavirus pandemic, a move officials have long resisted but are now reluctantly embracing to safeguard homeless people.",
            "About 80 tents are now neatly spaced out on a wide street near San Francisco City Hall as part of a “safe-sleeping village” opened last week. The area between the city’s central library and its Asian Art Museum is fenced off to outsiders, monitored around the clock and provides meals, showers, clean water and trash pickup.",
            "In announcing the encampment, and a second one to open in the famed Haight-Ashbury neighborhood, San Francisco’s mayor acknowledged that she didn’t want to approve tents, but having unregulated tents mushroom on sidewalks was neither safe nor fair.",
            "“So while in normal times I would say that we should focus on bringing people inside and not sanctioning tent encampments, we frankly do not have many other options right now,” she said in a tweet last week.",
            "Nicholas Woodward, 37, is camping at the safe sleeping site, but he said he preferred sleeping in his tent before the city stepped in; he finds the fencing belittling and the rules too controlling. His friend, Nathan Rice, 32, said he’d much rather have a hotel room than a tent on a sidewalk, even if the city is providing clean water and food.",
            "“I hear it on the news, hear it from people here that they’re going to be getting us hotel rooms,” he said. “That’s what we want, you know, to be safe inside.”",
            "San Francisco has moved 1,300 homeless people into hotel rooms and RVs as part of a statewide program to shelter vulnerable people but the mayor has been criticized for moving too slowly. She has said she is not inclined to move all the city’s estimated 8,000 homeless into hotels, despite complaints from advocates who say overcrowded tents are a public health disaster.",
            "San Francisco is just the latest city to authorize encampments as shelters across the country move to thin bed counts so homeless people, who are particularly susceptible to the virus due to poor health, have more room to keep apart.",
            "Santa Rosa in Sonoma County welcomed people this week to its first managed encampment with roughly 70 blue tents. Portland, Oregon, has three homeless camps with city-provided sleeping bags and tents, and Maricopa County opened two parking lots to homeless campers in Phoenix.",
            "San Francisco officials have historically frowned upon mini tent cities and routinely rounded up tents on city streets. But with an estimated 150,000 homeless people in California, most of them living out in the open, it’s impossible to stamp out the highly visible tents along highways and on crowded urban sidewalks.",
            "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that officials not disturb tent encampments during the coronavirus pandemic unless people are given individual hotel rooms, as homeless advocates want to see. Those advocates say providing a safe space where people can get meals, use a toilet and avoid harassing passers-by is a reasonable option given the times.",
            "“The best, best option would be housing. The second-best option would be hotel rooms, but if you can’t do that and we’re going to have so many people outside then I think it makes sense ... to make those outside as safe as can be,” said Dr. Margot Kushel, director of the Center for Vulnerable Populations at the University of California, San Francisco.",
            "But Nan Roman, president and CEO of the National Alliance to End Homelessness, said the federal government is providing an astonishing amount of money to battle the pandemic and she hopes cities and counties use it to put people into empty hotels, motels and other unused places.",
            "“It’s almost like we’re giving ourselves permission that it’s OK that people will sleep outside, and once we’ve given ourselves that permission, it’s very difficult to get the initiative together to do otherwise,” she said.",
            "Still, government-sanctioned tent camps may be here to stay, at least until a coronavirus vaccine is distributed.",
            "At the urging of San Francisco Supervisor Sandra Lee Fewer, the city’s parks and real estate departments are compiling an inventory of open spaces that might be suitable for tent camps. She said sidewalk space is a coveted commodity for retailers, given coronavirus restrictions, and the city’s strategy of adding more shelter beds doesn’t make sense with a contagious virus.",
            "“It is just a new world that we’re living in,” she said, “and it’s going to have to be our new normal.”"

            "Draped in Spanish flags and filled with protesters shouting “freedom,” “resign now” and “Viva Espana,” hundreds of cars, motorbikes and mopeds descended on Madrid’s center early Saturday.",
            "The so-called Caravan for Spain and Liberty protest against the left-wing government’s handling of the coronavirus outbreak was organized by the far right-wing Vox party, which emerged after years of near-obscurity to win 52 seats in Congress last April, double expectations. Founded by members of the Popular Party, Vox is known as a nationalist, anti-immigrant and ultraconservative political formation.",
            "The party accuses the government of Socialist Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez of misleading the public about the impact of the health crisis and of violating Spaniards’ rights by confining people to their homes and closing business during the lockdown.",
            "Vox called for protesters to attend the protests in their vehicles and thus skirt the current prohibition on social gatherings in effect under the nation’s two-month-long state of emergency designed to reduce contagion risk.",
            "Spain’s government says that the confinement measures have been necessary to save the nation’s hospitals from collapse and to keep the hard-hit country from losing thousands of additional lives.",
            "In the crowd of thousands on Saturday was Vox leader Santiago Abascal, who rode in the top of a red and yellow bus, covered with antigovernment hashtags. Other protests organized by Vox took place in Barcelona and elsewhere in the country, but Madrid’s may have been the biggest:",
            "Throngs of flag-waving protestors lined Paseo de la Castellana, clapping, waving Spanish flags and shouting enthusiastic support at the cars, and calling on Sánchez and his government to resign. Others hopped out of those autos in standstill traffic, at times bumping up against fellow supporters in perhaps less-than-ideal social spacing.",
            "It’s a scene that would have been unthinkable just a month ago in a country that has endured one of the strictest lockdowns in the world and one of the worst outbreaks, with nearly 30,000 dead and over 230,000 infected.",
            "Abascal himself contracted the virus after a massive party rally in Madrid in early March, days before the government declared a state of emergency. A women’s march held on the same day was also blamed by some for spreading the deadly infection.",
            "Among the protesters were Jacobo Sánchez and his two children. “We are at home for two to three months, and the government has helped the people to pass the crisis and to save their positions and they are thinking only of themselves,” said Sánchez, when asked why he had come.",
            "“Firstly, they need to explain, crystal clear, the situation — sanitary, economic and all the circumstances today in Spain, and the government is blank,” said Sanchez, who added that he has been working from home.",
            "Another protester on foot and draped in a Spanish flag, identifying himself only as Joaquín, complained that “with these people in the government right now, we don’t have a future. What they want to have is a dictatorship.”",
            "Spain’s government declared a state of emergency on March 14 but Madrid, is about to ease the lockdown to Phase 1 on Monday, and businesses across the city are reopening, though restrictions on movement out of the region remain.",
            "Along with Barcelona, Madrid has been slow to exit lockdown because Spain’s premier cities have seen the most infections and death. The country relies heavily on tourism, and closed borders have left around 30% of the country’s labor force out of work and reliant on handouts and government support.",
            "Spain will reopen to overseas tourists from July, the prime minister announced Saturday, pledging that the government will guarantee the safety of visitors and locals amid the emergence from the strict coronavirus lockdown.",
            "Saturday's protests follow recent demonstrations in the wealthy Salamanca neighborhood of Madrid, where mask-wearing residents have taken to the streets to complain about the lockdown and what some see as a power grab by Sánchez.",
            "A few blocks away in Puerta del Sol, a handful of protesters were standing two meters apart, waving Spanish Communist Worker Party flags and demanding more support and help for employees in the country. On the sidelines was topless street sex worker and actress, Andrea Garcia Garrera, who drew a small crowd of reporters and police with her shouts of “Prostitutes have the right to eat too!”",
            "Garrera said she has survived the past few weeks by living off of savings. “I’m here revealing myself so that the whole world knows that prostitutes need to eat, we need to pay our mortgages and lights and water bills, and no one is helping us.”",
            "But unlike the Caravan protesters, she said she doesn’t blame Sánchez’s government for the coronavirus response, something that she says is hard for anyone to cope with. “But they could help us more,” she said.",

            "Even as he was subjected to three years of disparaging remarks by and expressions of disappointment from President Donald Trump, former Attorney General Jeff Sessions held out hope of a Trump endorsement of his bid for a Senate seat from Alabama. He was, after all, the first senator and one of the first sitting members of Congress to endorse Trump’s 2016 presidential candidacy, and the first two congressmen to back Trump, Chris Collins of New York and Duncan Hunter of California, have ended up with prison sentences.",
            "Sessions is even believed to have brought influential adviser Stephen Miller into the Trump fold.",
            "Sessions, who represented Alabama in the Senate from 1997 to 2017, remained publicly loyal to Trump, even as he was forced to resign as head of the Justice Department, replaced by his own chief of staff via tweet, and even as Trump — whose brand generally precludes any admission of error — characterized picking Sessions to serve as attorney general as his biggest regret.",
            "Though he knew, as did even the most casual of political observers, that Trump resented Sessions’s recusing himself from the investigation into Russia’s alleged efforts to sabotage the 2016 election and any coordination with the Trump campaign, paving a path for the appointment of Robert Mueller as special counsel, Sessions might have hoped when he announced he would seek to be returned to the Senate by Alabama voters this fall that the Trump team would reward his long-standing loyalty.",
            "That hope was dashed by mid-March, as Trump gave his endorsement to Tommy Tuberville, till 2016 a well-traveled college football coach whose longest head-coaching stint had been in Alabama at Auburn University, in a runoff that had been set for late March but was postponed to July 14. The president had been silent on his preference before the early March primary, in which less than two percentage points ultimately separated Tuberville, who finished first, and Sessions, with five additional Republican candidates claiming a combined vote share that exceeded either Tuberville’s or Sessions’s total.",
            "Earlier this week, leading Sessions in the polls and less than two months from the runoff, and likely cognizant that the runoff would be decided by voters who’d picked neither of the top two finishers the last time they’d cast ballots (as well as Trump’s +28 net approval in the state, according to the latest Morning Consult data), Tuberville sought to burnish his Trump bona fides by commemorating on Twitter the third anniversary of Sessions’s recusal, referring to that action as throwing Trump to the wolves.",
            "If Tuberville had been seeking a reaffirmation of Trump’s endorsement, the president, by Friday evening, obliged:",
            "Sessions, remaining cordial toward the president (using, for example, the term “exoneration” in regard to the Mueller investigation’s result when Mueller, and his report, explicitly said Trump would have been exonerated if the facts permitted, and that they did not) even after being accused of letting the country down, responded in a measured tone with this brace of tweets:",
            "Then, on Saturday, Sessions reminded the president of his support of Trump’s fledgling political career:",
            "It did not spark nostalgia from the president’s Twitter feed, which observed that Sessions had failed the loyalty test that mattered most to him, going on to take shots at the incumbent in the seat for which Sessions and Tuberville are vying, Democratic Sen. Doug Jones, and the Democratic leaders of the House and Senate:",

            "As President Donald Trump pushes to reopen the country despite warnings from doctors about the consequences of moving too quickly during the coronavirus crisis, he has been lashing out at scientists whose conclusions he doesn’t like, while it’s been reported that the Republican Party has been trawling for “extremely pro-Trump” doctors to go on television and express support for Trump’s preferred quick opening of the economy rather than abiding by the cautionary recommendations of mainline public health experts.",
            "See:Kansas Republican congressman says he and several family members are taking hydroxychloroquine; he’s seeking Trump endorsement of his Senate bid",
            "Twice this week, Trump has not only dismissed the findings of studies but suggested — without evidence — that their authors were motivated by politics and out to undermine his efforts to roll back coronavirus restrictions.",
            "First it was a study funded in part by his own government’s National Institutes of Health that raised alarms about the use of hydroxychloroquine, finding higher overall mortality in coronavirus patients who took the drug while in Veterans Administration hospitals. Trump and many of his allies had been touting the drug as a miracle cure, and Trump this week revealed that he has been taking it to try to ward off the virus — despite an FDA warning last month that it should only be used in hospital settings or clinical trials because of the risk of serious side effects, including life-threatening heart problems.",
            "The Margin:After Trump says he’s taking hydroxychloroquine, many sound alarm over the malaria drug’s documented risks",
            "The Lancet, one of the world’s oldest and most well-respected medical journals, published a new study Friday that echoed those findings.",
            "“If you look at the one survey, the only bad survey, they were giving it to people that were in very bad shape. They were very old, almost dead,” Trump told reporters Tuesday. “It was a Trump-enemy statement.”",
            "Also see:As Sen. Chuck Schumer calls for $30 billion to fund a robust testing regime, Sen. Debbie Stabenow observes that the U.S. leads the world in coronavirus infections and lags the world in testing",
            "Trump offered similar pushback Thursday to a new study from Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health. It found that more than 61% of COVID-19 infections and 55% of reported deaths — nearly 36,000 people — could have been been prevented had social distancing measures been put in place one week sooner. Trump has repeatedly defended his administration’s handling of the virus in the face of persistent criticism that he acted too slowly.",
            "“Columbia’s an institution that’s very liberal,” Trump told reporters Thursday. “I think it’s just a political hit job, [if] you want to know the truth.”",
            "Trump has long been skeptical of mainstream science — dismissing human-made climate change as a “hoax,” suggesting that noise from wind turbines causes cancer and claiming that exercise can deplete a body’s finite amount of energy. It’s part of a larger skepticism of expertise and backlash against “elites” that has become increasingly popular among Trump’s base.",
            "But undermining Americans’ trust in the integrity and objectivity of scientists is especially dangerous during a pandemic when the public is relying on its leaders to develop policies based on the best available information, said Larry Gostin, a Georgetown University law professor who is an expert in public health.",
            "“We have every right to expect that our leaders will use the best science to keep us safe and protect us,” Gostin said. “And so the idea that you reject objective scientific information that could inform policies that have life or death consequences is unfathomable.”",
            "The White House rejected that thinking, noting that Trump has followed his administration’s public health officials’ recommendations through much of the crisis.",
            "“Any suggestion that the president does not value scientific data or the important work of scientists is patently false as evidenced by the many data-driven decision he has made to address the COVID-19 pandemic, including cutting off travel early from highly infected populations, expediting vaccine development, issuing the 15-day and later 30-day guidance to ‘slow the spread,’ and providing governors with a clear, safe road map to opening up America again,” White House spokesman Judd Deere said.",
            "Yet Trump has made clear that, at least when it comes to hydroxychloroquine, he has prioritized anecdotal evidence, including a letter he told reporters he’d received from a doctor in Westchester County in New York claiming success with the drug.",
            "Asked this week what evidence he had that the drug was effective in preventing COVID-19 — contrary to FDA guidance — Trump responded: “Are you ready? Here’s my evidence: I get a lot of positive calls about it.”",
            "“The only negative I’ve heard,” he added, “was the study where they gave it — was it the VA? — with, you know, people that aren’t big Trump fans.”",
            "There is no evidence that the study, funded by grants from the NIH and the University of Virginia, was influenced by anyone’s opinions about Trump. The retrospective analysis was conducted by researchers at several universities and looked at the impact of hydroxychloroquine in patients at veterans’ hospitals across the nation. It found no benefit and more deaths among those given hydroxychloroquine versus standard care alone. That work was posted online for researchers and has not been reviewed by other scientists, but a larger observational study that looked at the outcomes of nearly 100,000 patients in 671 hospitals on six continents published Friday sounded similar alarms.",
            "The Columbia study, in draft form, also hasn’t yet been published or reviewed by other experts. The researchers ran numbers through a mathematical model, making assumptions about how quickly the coronavirus spreads and how people behave in hypothetical circumstances.",
            "Trump’s criticism of the studies also comes as his allies have been eager to counter messaging from public health experts who say Trump is putting lives at risk by pushing states to quickly reopen in an election year. Republican political operatives have been recruiting pro-Trump doctors to go on television to advocate for reviving the U.S. economy as quickly as possible, without waiting to meet federal safety benchmarks.",
            "Gostin said Trump should leave it to his public health agencies to assess emerging data and the value of various studies.",
            "“I think there are real dangers,” he said, “for the president to play scientist and doctor on TV.”"

            "“That is something of grave concern, that is why we’re actively trying to confirm if anybody saw anybody in this building,” he told KGO-TV.",
            "“To our knowledge ... nobody is supposed to be in the building and we are hoping ... that there is no victim,” he said.",
            "The fire broke out before dawn and tore through the warehouse near the end of the concrete pier, causing its walls to collapse, Baxter said. The first fire truck to respond to the scene sustained some damage.",
            "More than 130 firefighters fought the flames, with some using ladder trucks to drench the warehouse from above. A fire boat was used to protect the SS Jeremiah O’Brien, a liberty ship that stormed Normandy on D-Day in 1944. The ship docks by Pier 45 and is a popular tourist attraction.",
            "“Our firefighters absolutely saved the SS Jeremiah O’Brien during this fire as flames were pinching on the side of this vessel,” Baxter said.",
            "Coast Guard crew members and police assisted by keeping other vessels away from the pier.",
            "Fire investigators were assessing any damage to the pier and were looking into the cause of the blaze, Baxter said."

            "When it comes to social distancing, Broadway theaters have a serious problem. They’re architecturally glorious—also old, dusty, and cramped.",
            "“I was already a germaphobe,” says veteran Broadway conductor Todd Ellison, chuckling. “With this coronavirus, we’re all going to be more aware now.”",
            "Aware of every cough. Every sniffle. Every sneeze. If you thought the lady behind you rustling her candy wrapper was annoying, just wait till you return to the theater after Covid-19 lockdown restrictions are lifted.",
            "That’s the subject being hotly debated in daily Zoom meetings among actors, directors, producers, and theater owners on Broadway, around London’s West End, and at regional theaters around the world. Penta reached out to a host of these practitioners, here and abroad, to get a sense of what they envision. ",
            "They’re weighing all possible options, some already being test-driven in places such as South Korea (where theaters never closed) or Germany (where they’re reopening). Imagine lobbies with disinfectant showers, or drive-in theaters where audiences watch stage shows from the comfort of their car—anything to reassure theatergoers, thereby boosting attendance and helping recoup this year’s serious financial losses.",
            "“We’re hoping we don’t have to wait for a vaccine to reopen,” says Charlotte St. Martin, president of the Broadway League, the national trade organization for Broadway theater owners and operators, which announced this week a star-studded Broadway celebration (stars to be named, but expect heavy hitters) live-streamed on TonyAwards.com and BroadwayOnDemand.com on June 7, in lieu of CBS’s canceled Tony Awards telecast.",
            "Broadway could use a lift. The Great White Way shut down March 12, with 16 new shows on the cusp of opening. Theaters remain shuttered through Labor Day, but when they’ll actually reopen is anybody’s guess. Some shows closed for good. Others, like Plaza Suite (starring Sarah Jessica Parker and Matthew Broderick), which had expected to open last month, and the Michael Jackson songfest MJ The Musical, due this summer, have been pushed back to next spring.",
            "“ I think it’s foolish to imagine people will be willing to gather with strangers in a dark room while they’re still worried about getting infected. ”",
            "In London, where West End theaters are dark through at least June 28, Stephen Sondheim’s Sunday in the Park with George, starring Jake Gyllenhaal and Tony winner Annaleigh Ashford, slated for mid-June, jumped to 2021.",
            "By then—so the wishful thinking goes—we’ll have a vaccine, or reliable instant testing, or herd immunity, something to make consumers feel safe.",
            "“It’s foolish to imagine people will be willing to gather with strangers in a dark room while they’re still worried about getting infected,” says Oskar Eustis, artistic director of New York’s Public Theater.",
            "He should know. He was hospitalized with a grueling case of Covid-19 in March. It’s not just a flu, he warns. “I’ve had the flu. That was not like the flu.”",
            "Moulin Rouge star Danny Burstein can identify. Soon after Broadway’s shutdown a fellow cast member was diagnosed with Covid-19, and Burstein found himself hospitalized, testing positive and fighting for his life about a week later. “You wish so hard it had never happened to you,” he says. “It’s a sad and lonely experience.”",
            "Despite this, he’s eager to get back to work. But how? When? “Hopefully,” he says, “we’ll be guided by the science.”",
            "Oodles of… Pool Noodles?",
            "We’ll also be guided by what works in other countries.",
            "In Switzerland, where theaters may reopen next month, the Swiss theater union issued a 54-page guidebook, citing new rules such as hourly 15-minute breaks during rehearsals to air out spaces. In Germany, one Hamburg theater is attempting social-distanced rehearsals, with actors wearing pool-noodle corsets, of sorts. (Imagine a tic-tac-toe board made of foam poles—you step into the center square and pull the contraption up to your hips, noodles akimbo, providing a buffer between you and cast mates.) Presumably this won’t be used in performances, but a video of their rehearsals looks like a Saturday Night Live spoof.",
            "In Seoul, where The Phantom of the Opera is now playing on tour, ticket holders pass through a “disinfectant shower” (reportedly a light mist), have their temperatures taken, wear masks inside the theater and provide full contact information. This proved useful in March, when two cast members were diagnosed with Covid-19. Authorities closed the show, quarantined cast and crew for two weeks, and contacted more than 8,500 attendees to alert them to their potential exposure. No further cases were reported.",
            "If we improved our still-woefully-inadequate testing, could that work in the U.S.?",
            "“Those of us onstage are more than willing to do our part,” says two-time Tony winner Patti LuPone, star of the recent Company revival shut down shortly before opening. “But is the audience willing to do theirs? I think most will—but have you seen those videos on YouTube?”",
            "She was referring to the increasing number of anti-maskers caught on camera throwing fits over mask-only rules at places like Costco and McDonald’s.",
            "“We have taken keen note of the theater in South Korea and… how that’s going, but it’s still early days,” says Steven Schnepp, president of the Broadway Booking Office, which was overseeing the booking and marketing of nine tours, including Les Misérables and Jersey Boys,all forced to close. In February, they’d beefed up safety protocols, requiring additional theater cleaning, hand sanitizer in the lobbies, and reduced “stage dooring.”",
            "Phantom creator Andrew Lloyd Webber, also Seoul-inspired, has pledged to buy self-sanitizing door handles for his theaters.",
            "Still, Seoul’s generally newer theaters may prove difficult to emulate.",
            "“The logistics are tougher in Broadway’s tight quarters, or the old Victorian theaters of the West End,” says British director Jonathan Butterell, whose Olivier-nominated hit West End musical, Everybody’s Talking About Jamie, tours South Korea this summer.",
            "The reality is no one-size-solution exists, he says.",
            "“There are no rules anymore,’” says Sarahbeth Grossman, a Tony-nominated producer of Broadway’s Indecent and An American in Paris, and artistic producer for the Dallas Theater Center. “We have an opportunity now to come up with all-new ways of making theater, and theater spaces, or reviving old, forgotten ideas that may prove useful.”",
            "What’s Old Is New Again",
            "Almost all the theater veterans we surveyed agreed that social-distanced seating in theaters—requiring shows to play to half-full houses—won’t work financially.",
            "“An auditorium only 40% full with everyone wearing a mask is hardly conducive to a good comedy, is it?” notes Tony- and Olivier Award-winning director Michael Grandage. The whole point of theater is to create intimacy, a shared experience.",
            "He’s looking to pro sports. “If soccer, for instance, can demonstrate that through testing and other means there is body contact on the pitch with no risk, then there is potentially a model for how the theater can rehearse and perform,” he says.",
            "Until then, some producers are going retro. Grossman and her Dallas colleagues have considered possible outdoor “drive-in” productions, and BBC Radio has begun airing dramatizations of recently shuttered London plays, a la classic radio dramas of old.",
            "Of course, there’s the flood of digital offerings, from the National Theatre’s weekly live stream of filmed stage shows (One Man, Two Guvnors, starring James Corden, attracted 200,000 views) to acclaimed playwright Richard Nelson’s new Zoom-inspired play “What Do We Need to Talk About?” featuring five isolated actors in a video chat running through June 28 on PublicTheater.org.",
            "And for the first time, people across the globe experienced a Public Theater production at the same time New Yorkers did. “They got it in Shanghai, Tashkent (in Uzbekistan), London, and here, all at once,” Eustis says. “That was mind-blowing.”",
            "At the Broadway League, St. Martin expresses a similar optimism. A former hotel executive, she knows it took years to revive New York’s hotel occupancy post-9/11. Theater is a basic human need, part of our DNA, she says. There’s something about the collective experience, “sharing with others the laughter, tears, those gasps of shock. It will come back. But it will take time.”",
            "When it does, performers like Burstein will be ready.",
            "“I just feel bad for the first guy in the audience who coughs,” he says. “He’ll be, ‘Hey, it’s just allergies.’ And everybody’ll think, ‘Yeah, right.’”",
            "Two very different companies found their shares climbing together as the crisis deepened. But what will happen as cooped-up people emerge?"

As I pay 100% of everything in the household, I will never give my wife $1,200 to blow her stimulus check in the store, while I’m struggling to make ends meet.",

            "Because it doesn’t have your name on it, even if it’s deposited into a joint bank account. Because it’s a tax credit based on your 2020 tax returns. Because if you file a joint tax return, the $2,400 check should be split. Because if your wife files her own $1,200 tax return, it belongs to her.",
            "Because controlling how much money you give to your wife from her stimulus infantilizes her. Because she’s not a child, she’s an adult and your wife. Because you vowed to love and honor each other. Because dishing out a few hundred dollars from her check is demeaning and patronizing.",
            "I received my ex-husband’s $1,200 stimulus check because we filed joint taxes in 2018. Should I give him the money or return it to the IRS?",
            "Because your decision to withhold her stimulus check says more about you than it does about her. Because maintaining such control over the purse strings can’t make either of you happy. Because sitting down together and coming up with a family budget might lead to a healthier and happier life.",
            "Because it’s always better to treat others as you would like to be treated. Because if it’s hysterical it’s historical. Because a marriage should be a partnership of equals, not an opportunity to live out some childhood grievances by controlling others. Because this is an opportunity to look at yourself.",
            "Dispatches from a pandemic: Letter from New York: ‘New Yorkers wear colorful homemade masks, while nurses wear garbage bags’",
            "Because love is not a four-letter word — love is an action. Because love is not transactional. Because you don’t show your wife respect by making these decisions for her. Because many women choose to be homemakers and raise children, and put family before career, and it’s a full-time job.",
            "Because we should always endeavor to imagine ourselves at 80 or 90 or beyond, and think, ‘What would have been the most honorable thing to do?’ and do that. Because it’s never too late to use a public-health emergency to reevaluate our relationship with the world, ourselves and each other.",

            "Because whether you like it or not she has made sacrifices too. Because your wife, like everyone else, probably has her struggles too. Because her struggles may also be related to choices she made, including her choice to marry you over, say, the other guy who would have worshipped her.",
            "Because she may wonder, in the quiet of night, what happened to the man she married. Because you may wonder what happened to the woman you married. Because it’s mature to take 50/50 responsibility for your life, your relationship, and your finances, even if there’s one earner.",
            "‘I owe child support from my first marriage and did not receive a stimulus check. Does Trump not realize I have another family to take care of?’",
            "Because we often believe this, that or the other is somebody’s else’s fault. Because we are all responsible for our own choices, including you. Because what would your life be like without your wife? Because this need to keep it likely has nothing to do with her, and everything to do with you.",
            "Because this is an opportunity for you both to learn about give and take, and work together as a team rather than as two people living under the same roof. Because she won’t forget how it feels to have her check withheld. Because, even if it goes against your instincts, it’s the honorable thing to do.",

            "America is staring down a widespread COVID-19 testing shortage with no vaccine in sight. So what happens when coronavirus makes its unceremonious return?",
            "Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told the Financial Times that he “can’t guarantee” more stay-at-home requirements in the winter or the fall. “We are committed to using the time that we have now to get this nation as over-prepared as possible.”",
            "“We’ve seen evidence that the concerns it would go south in the southern hemisphere like flu [are coming true], and you’re seeing what’s happening in Brazil now,” Redfield told the U.K. paper, “and then when the southern hemisphere is over I suspect it will re-ground itself in the north.”",
            "“This simple respiratory viral pathogen has really brought my nation to its knees, and the reality is, it’s no one particular person’s fault,” he added. (A Columbia University study released this week said up to 36,000 lives could have been saved had U.S. economy shut down even one week earlier.)",
            "“ ‘We are committed to using the time that we have now to get this nation as over-prepared as possible.’ ”",
            "Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases for more than three decades, previously declared, “We will have coronavirus in the fall. I am convinced of that.” He previously said the “ultimate game changer” will be a vaccine, but that could take 12 to 18 months.",
            "“If we’re not expecting a second wave or a mutation of this virus, then we have learned nothing,” New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, CMCSA, -0.53% added, calling it a “new normal” for public health in the U.S. “That is why it is such an important period for government.”",
            "First, the bad news: “The four seasonal coronaviruses do not seem to induce long-term immunity,” said Gregory Poland, who studies the immunogenetics of vaccine response in adults and children at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., and expert with the Infectious Diseases Society of America.",
            "“We will not have a vaccine by next winter,” Poland added. “The Southern Hemisphere is just starting their fall and winter. They will have a severe course of this disease due to less preparedness, less medical infrastructure and less public infrastructure.”",
            "“There’s a possibility that the assault of the virus on our nation next winter will actually be even more difficult than the one we just went through,” Redfield, the CDC director, previously told The Washington Post.",
            "Letter from New York:‘When I hear an ambulance, I wonder if there’s a coronavirus patient inside. Are there more 911 calls, or do I notice every distant siren?’",
            "Coronavirus immunity differs from other diseases. Immunizations against smallpox, measles or Hepatitis B should last a lifetime, Poland said. Coronaviruses, first discovered in the 1960s, interact with our immune system in unique and different ways, he added.",
            "How do other coronaviruses compare to SARS-CoV-2? People infected by SARS-CoV, an outbreak that centered in southern China and Hong Kong from 2002 to 2004, had immunity for roughly two years; studies suggest the antibodies disappear six years after the infection.",
            "For MERS-CoV, a coronavirus that has caused hundreds of cases in the Middle East, people retain immunity for approximately 18 months — although the long-term response to being exposed to the virus again may depend on the severity of the original infection.",
            "The world, Poland said, should brace itself for round two: “We will start moving into our summer when they’re moving into their winter,” he said. “If, as is likely, we don’t restrict all travel, cases will start coming back into the Northern Hemisphere and we’ll have another outbreak this fall.”",
            "Without a vaccine, “herd immunity” is another option. That theory was briefly considered in the U.K. as an alternative to closing businesses and practicing social distancing, but was deemed too risky. Ultimately, enough people would need to be immune to shield the most vulnerable.",
            "“There’s no chance that immunity is going to be high enough to reach herd immunity,” Poland said. “With influenza, you need herd immunity of 60% to 70%. With measles, you need about 95%. With COVID-19, it’s somewhere in the middle.”",
            "In the absence of a vaccine, Poland said several conditions are necessary for herd immunity to work: a very high level of population immunity, for that immunity to be durable, and for the virus to not mutate. “None of those seem to be operational at present,” he said.",
            "“ With influenza, you need herd immunity of 60% to 70%. With measles, you need about 95%. With COVID-19, it’s somewhere in the middle. ”",
            "In addition to the level of herd immunity (or lack thereof) to protect those who are most vulnerable, people will have to be cognizant of the disease spreading through asymptomatic carriers — that is, people who are infected but show no signs that they’re ill.",
            "For example, a New England Journal of Medicine study published this month found that 29 (or 14%) of 210 pregnant women arriving at New York–Presbyterian Allen Hospital and Columbia University Irving Medical Center tested positive for COVID-19, yet displayed no symptoms.",
            "“Our use of universal SARS-CoV-2 testing in all pregnant patients presenting for delivery revealed that at this point in the pandemic in New York City, most of the patients who were positive for SARS-CoV-2 at delivery were asymptomatic,” the study concluded.",
            "“It underscores the risk of Covid-19 among asymptomatic obstetrical patients,” added the study, which was published earlier this month. “Moreover, the true prevalence of infection may be underreported because of false negative results of tests to detect SARS-CoV-2.”",
            "So what will happen if or when SARS-CoV-2, which causes the respiratory disease COVID-19, returns? “We’re just 14 weeks into this, so no one knows,” Poland said. If it has a slight mutation, he added, the response of our antibodies will be “moderately irrelevant.”",
            "We can’t expect to have the same “herd immunity” or “original antigenic sin” — the ability of our immune systems to remember a virus that is similar, but not the same, as a previous version — as influenza. Influenza, after all, has been around for 500, if not 1,000 years.",
            "“During the great influenza pandemic of 1918, the age group that disproportionately died were young people, not older adults,” Poland said. “Older adults had seen previews of this virus in earlier years, probably in the late 1800s, so they had immunological memory.”",
            "“ ‘The 1918 Spanish flu’s second wave was even more devastating than the first wave. COVID-19’s sweet spot could be October to May.’ ”",
            "There are similarities between influenza and SARS-CoV-2, and they have almost identical symptoms — fever, coughing, night sweats, aching bones, tiredness, and nausea and diarrhea in the most severe cases. Like all viruses, neither are treatable with antibiotics.",
            "They can both be spread through respiratory droplets from coughing and sneezing, but they come from two different virus families — and ongoing research to develop a universal vaccine for influenza shows how tricky both influenza viruses and coronaviruses can be.",
            "“The 1918 Spanish flu’s second wave was even more devastating than the first wave,” Ravina Kullar, an infectious-disease expert with the Infectious Diseases Society of America and adjunct faculty member at the University of California, Los Angeles, told MarketWatch.",
            "Historians believe that a more virulent influenza strain hit during a hard three months in 1918 and was spread by troops moving through Europe during the First World War. A mutated strain would be a worst-case scenario for a second wave of SARS-CoV-2 this fall or winter.",
            "The 1918 pandemic is forever associated with Spain, but this strain of H1-N1 was discovered earlier in Germany, France, the U.K. and the U.S., but similar to the Communist Party’s response to first cases of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China, First World War censors buried or underplayed those reports.",
            "”It is essential to consider the deep connections between the Great War and the influenza pandemic not simply as concurrent or consecutive crises, but more deeply intertwined,” historian James Harris wrote in an essay on the pandemic.",
            "“ A more virulent, mutated strain of the novel coronavirus would be a worst-case scenario for a second wave of SARS-CoV-2 this fall or winter. ”",
            "The British military medicine took a leading role in studying the public-health response, he added. “Domestic public-health leaders did almost nothing to stem the spread of the pandemic due to the impact measures such as quarantine would have had on the war effort.",
            "Doctors and members of the public, as of now, were spooked by how otherwise strong, healthy people fell victim to the 1918 influenza. Doctors today attribute that to the “cytokine storm,” a process where the immune system in healthy people reacts so strongly as to hurt the body.",
            "A hallmark of some viruses: A surge of immune cells and their activating compounds (cytokines) effectively turned the body against itself, led to an inflammation of the lungs, severe respiratory distress, leaving the body vulnerable to secondary bacterial pneumonia.",
            "And the second wave of SARS-CoV-2? “It will likely hit harder in areas not severely impacted the first time in the interior of the U.S., where there’s a lot more susceptible people,” Kullar said. “COVID-19’s sweet spot could be October to May, with it peaking, likely, in October and November.”",
            "Kullar said scientists are learning something new every day from modeling studies. “If it follows the same pattern as influenza, it will likely level off during the summertime,” she said. “If immunity is in existence, then likely the virus will come back looking for new victims.”",
            "What’s more, Redfield told the Washington Post that he’s been in talks with state officials about the potential for using U.S. Census Bureau, Peace Corps and AmeriCorps volunteers to create what he called “an alternative workforce” to help with contact tracing for those who test positive.",
            "There is reason to be optimistic. “We still have a lot to learn about the flu, even though we’ve had flu vaccines since the mid-1940s,” Poland said. “It’s amazing what the world has done in 14 weeks on COVID-19, but what’s more amazing is how much more there is to learn.”",
            "In a few short months, scientists around the world have learned a lot about SARS-CoV-2, including the virus’s genetic structure; how it infects human cells; what kind of disease manifestation it causes; and how it impacts the liver, kidney and brain, and how secondary symptoms affect children.",
            "“ ‘We really need to have wide-scale testing available, and contact tracing to find everyone who has been exposed.’ ”",
            "What else, aside from social distancing to “flatten the curve” of new infections, can be done between now and then? While scientists work to crack the code of the novel coronavirus, the government and members of the public can work together.",
            "“It all comes down to testing,” Kullar said. “We really need to have wide-scale testing available, and contact tracing to find everyone who has been exposed and get them to self-isolate for 14 days. We don’t have a system like that in the U.S. at present.”",
            "As of Sunday, 13.7 million people had been tested in the U.S. There were 1,622,990 confirmed cases of COVID-19, and 96,046 deaths in the U.S. Worldwide, there were 5,335,868 confirmed cases and at least 341,513 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins Whiting School of Engineering.",
            "Cuomo said he won’t be swayed by protesters in the capital, adding that the CDC set reopening guidelines for states, and he will close again after reopening, if need be. “The health-care system cannot go over 70% capacity. There’s a two-week lag. At 70%, bells should go off.”",
            "Dispatches from a pandemic: New York’s empty streets remind me of my childhood in a Wild West ghost town — how America can revive itself post-pandemic",
            "Assuming testing is up to speed by the end of summer, Kullar says Americans should be on a sound footing for round two of SARS-CoV-2 with, ideally, enough hospital supplies and testing in place to ensure we all make fewer mistakes next time around.",
            "In Europe, Andrea Ammon, director of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, told The Guardian newspaper that she too expects a second wave. “The question is when and how big,” she said, adding that 85% to 90% of the population is still susceptible.",
            "Ammon said SARS-CoV-2 is unlikely to just go away. “The virus is around us, circulating much more than January and February,” she said this week. “I don’t want to draw a doomsday picture but I think we have to be realistic. That it’s not the time now to completely relax.”",
            "In the meantime, a lot will come down to the public. “How we behave will really determine how big this virus is going to get,” she said. “Maintain social distancing and wear masks in public until we see infection rates go down, and keep doing it until we get enough testing.”"

            "Airlines are trying to fill at least some of the seats on the planes they have in the sky.",
            "Air travel in the U.S. has largely ground to a halt as people have grown wary about potentially exposing themselves to coronavirus. Many airlines have resorted to flying mostly empty flights — although in some cases, passengers have complained about crowded planes, as in the case of a recent United Airlines UAL, -1.70% flight.",
            "Jet Blue JBLU, -1.91% said this week it will continue to block middle seats on Airbus AIR, +8.51% planes in rows where people aren’t traveling together through July 4, and will block aisle seats on smaller Embraer ERJ, -1.69% 190 planes.",
            "“Even with blocked seats, it’s challenging to maintain six feet of distance between everyone onboard and that’s why JetBlue was the first U.S. airline to require face coverings for customers,” the airline said Wednesday. JetBlue will keep the seat distancing program in place through at least July 6.",
            "United announced a series of changes this week to help restore the public’s confidence in air travel, outlining how it will operate at airports and on board planes, including a partnership with Clorox Co. CLX, -0.40% for enhanced cleaning and another with medical experts from the Cleveland Clinic, as it works to keep passengers safe during the coronavirus pandemic.",
            "“ United will introduce sneeze guards at check-in counters, touchless kiosks in select locations for baggage check-in, mandatory face coverings for crew and customers, and will give passengers options when flights are over 70% full. ”",
            "The company on Wednesday unveiled new cleaning and safety protocols that include sneeze guards at check-in counters, touchless kiosks in select locations for baggage check-in, mandatory face coverings for crew and customers, new economy snack bags that will come with a sanitizing wipe, and providing individually wrapped hand sanitizer wipes to customers when they board. United will also limit advance seat selections when possible, and give passengers the option to take alternative flights when flights are over 70% full, the company said.",
            "This is a notable turnaround in policy for the airline, given criticism leveled at United in recent weeks. Earlier this month, Ethan Weiss, a University of California, San Francisco, cardiologist, shared a photo on Twitter TWTR, +0.86% showing nearly every seat full on the plane out of Newark Airport in New Jersey. He said customers were “shocked” and “scared.”",
            "“I guess @united is relaxing their social distancing policy these days? Every seat full on this 737,” Weiss wrote. “They could have avoided this by just communicating better,” Weiss added. “They literally just sent an email 10 days ago telling all of us the middle seats would be empty.” He was traveling with 25 other nurses and doctors who have been volunteering in New York hospitals.",
            "At the time, United said it could no longer guarantee all customers would be booked next to an empty seat. “Last month, we began limiting advanced seat selection for adjacent seats in all cabins, including middle seats where available and alternating window and aisle seats when seats are in pairs,” the company said in a statement to ABC7 DIS, +0.16%.",
            "Airlines for America, an industry trade group, released a summary in April of how U.S. airlines are improving cleaning and safety protocols. Alaska Airlines ALK, -2.57% increased its cleaning procedures between flights and is now using disinfectants that are effective against viruses, it said. American Airlines aircraft are cleaned at regular intervals throughout the day with disinfectant.",

            "Airlines are working to help contain and stop the spread of COVID-19, Airlines for America said. “The safety of passengers and employees is the top priority of U.S. airlines,” it added. “Since the onset of the novel coronavirus pandemic, carriers have been working closely with Congress, the Administration and federal agencies including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.”",
            "“There’s no doubt that these unprecedented times will lead to some major changes in the travel industry,” said travel expert Brian Kelly, also known as The Points Guy on his website. “Until a vaccine is developed, carriers will need to make customers feel safe. Increased cleaning is a start, but we’re likely to see demands for more protections, including health screening.”",
            "“ ‘Until a vaccine is developed, carriers will need to make customers feel safe. Increased cleaning is a start, but we’re likely to see demands for more protections, including health screening.’ ”",
            "“JetBlue was one of the first U.S. airlines to require that crew members wear masks and just recently extended the same rule to passengers,” Kelly wrote on his site. “In addition, JetBlue has limited the number of seats available for purchase, allowing for more space between customers. Crew members will continue to review seat assignments to comply with social-distancing guidelines.”",
            "U.S. airlines are considering taking similar actions to Chinese airlines.",
            "“United Arab Emirates-based Etihad has already begun testing new technology that would screen passengers for dangerous medical conditions like COVID-19 by monitoring their temperatures, heart rates and respiratory rates,” Kelly added. “However, many people with COVID-19 have been asymptomatic.”",
            "“In the U.S., Frontier Airlines recently implemented a program that requires passengers to accept a health acknowledgment prior to completing check-in via website or app,” Kelly said. “This is the first we’ve heard of any U.S. airline instituting its own health-screening check. This isn’t the most effective screening, but it’s a start.”",
            "See also:Frontier Airlines will drop social-distancing fee after wave of criticism",
            "Carriers’ stocks have had a rollercoaster ride in response to the nationwide economic shutdown due to the coronavirus. Warren Buffett recently revealed that Berkshire BRK.A, +0.45% had sold off all of its holdings in the airline sector, including stock in Delta DAL, -2.02%, American Airlines AAL, -1.92% and Southwest LUV, -2.46%.",
            "Boeing BA, -1.05% Chief Executive David Calhoun said a major airline will “most likely” go under as a result of the coronavirus pandemic during a recent appearance on NBC’s “Today” show. He added that it could take three to five years for the industry to recover to the passenger levels seen before the pandemic. Airlines, meanwhile, face an uphill struggle to convince passengers to fly.",
            "“Safety has always been our top priority, and right now in the midst of an unprecedented crisis, it’s our singular customer focus,” Scott Kirby, United’s Chief Executive, said in a video message to customers on Wednesday. “We recognize that COVID-19 has brought cleanliness and hygiene standards to the front of customers’ minds when making travel decisions.”",

            "Talking spreads coronavirus — and likely plays a part in its contagiousness.",
            "That’s the conclusion of a study published in the latest edition of the peer-reviewed Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the official journal of the National Academy of Sciences. “These observations confirm that there is a substantial probability that normal speaking causes airborne virus transmission in confined environments,” the study concludes.",
            "“ ‘Speech droplets generated by asymptomatic carriers of SARS-CoV-2 are increasingly considered to be a likely mode of disease transmission.’ ”",
            "The study adds to a growing body of research on why it’s important that people maintain social distancing and wear face masks. The response to COVID-19 has become a political issue. President Donald Trump and New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo have locked horns over when to reopen the economy.",
            "“Speech droplets generated by asymptomatic carriers of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are increasingly considered to be a likely mode of disease transmission,” the study found. “Highly sensitive laser light scattering observations have revealed that loud speech can emit thousands of oral fluid droplets per second.”",
            "In a closed, stagnant-air environment, they disappear from view after 8 minutes to 14 minutes, “which corresponds to droplet nuclei of ca. 4um diameter, or 12um to 21um droplets prior to dehydration,” the researchers wrote. One micrometer, um, is equivalent to one millionth of a meter. The coronavirus is 0.125 um. Medical-grade N95 masks are worn by medics because they can block particles of that size.",
            "The scientists said that, while it’s long been recognized that respiratory viruses such as coronavirus can be transmitted via droplets generated by coughing or sneezing, it’s less widely known that normal speaking also produces thousands of oral fluid droplets. High viral loads of SARS-CoV-2 have been detected in oral fluids of COVID-19−positive patients, including asymptomatic ones.",
            "Don’t miss:‘We will not have a vaccine by next winter.’ Like the 1918 Spanish flu, CDC says second wave of coronavirus could be worse. So what happens next?",
            "Some public spaces appear to be more hostile environments to coronavirus than others, according to a separate study published in the journal Nature Research by a team of investigators, led by Ke Lan, professor and director of the State Key Laboratory of Virology at Wuhan University in the Chinese region where COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, was first reported.",
            "“ Room ventilation, open space, sanitization of protective apparel, and proper use and disinfection of toilet areas can help reduce droplet spread. ”",
            "High-traffic areas are best to be avoided, especially where there’s moisture. After setting up traps for small aerosols (airborne particles) in two hospitals in Wuhan, the researchers found more coronavirus aerosols in patients’ bathrooms and in changing rooms for doctors. “The potential for aerosol transmission is poorly understood,” the researchers wrote.",
            "The study had some good news for hospitals: There were fewer aerosols in isolation wards and patient rooms with good ventilation and thorough sanitization, that study found. “Our results indicate that room ventilation, open space, sanitization of protective apparel, and proper use and disinfection of toilet areas can effectively limit the concentration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in aerosols,” they wrote.",
            "Public transportation is also a hot spot, according to a working paper released on April 24 by Jeffrey Harris, professor in the Department of Economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology: “Maps of subway station turnstile entries, superimposed upon zip code-level maps of reported coronavirus incidence, are strongly consistent with subway-facilitated disease propagation.”",
            "The number of cases, meanwhile, continues to rise. As of Sunday, 13.7 million people had been tested in the U.S. There were 1,622,990 confirmed cases of COVID-19, and 96,046 deaths in the U.S. Worldwide, there were 5,335,868 confirmed cases and at least 341,513 deaths, according to the latest data from the Johns Hopkins Whiting School of Engineering.",
            "Also see:Mike Pence acknowledges he made a mistake by visiting patients without a mask, but health-care workers say Mayo Clinic has serious soul-searching to do",
            "Another study in The New England Journal of Medicine from scientists at Princeton University, UCLA and the National Institutes of Health concluded that the virus could remain airborne for “up to 3 hours post aerosolization.” It was detectable in the air for up to three hours, up to 4 hours on copper, up to 24 hours on cardboard, and 2-3 days on plastic and stainless steel.",
            "“ ‘Once airborne, speech-generated droplets rapidly dehydrate due to evaporation, thereby decreasing in size and slowing their fall.’ ”",
            "Health professionals recommend you remain at least 6 feet away from others, but an investigation by researchers led by a team at the Academy of Military Medical Sciences in Beijing, published in Emerging Infectious Diseases, an open-access peer-reviewed journal published monthly by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said droplets can spread up to 13 feet.",
            "The life span of the virus will also vary, depending on the type of surface it is on, temperature and/or humidity. Bathrooms are a welcoming environment for coronaviruses. “Previous coronaviruses can remain viable in cold, moist surfaces up to nine days,” Ostrosky said. So if you are sharing a home with someone who has coronavirus, he strongly advises against sharing the same bathroom.",
            "As for traveling, in-flight oxygen on airplanes is likely of higher quality than the air in your home. “If you have an infected person in the front of the plane, and you’re in the back of the plane, your risk is close to zero simply because the area of exposure is thought to be roughly six feet from the infected person,” according to Charles Chiu, professor of laboratory medicine at University of California, San Francisco.",
            "The good news: The terminal velocity of a falling coronavirus droplet scales as the square of its diameter, the latest study concluded. “Once airborne, speech-generated droplets rapidly dehydrate due to evaporation, thereby decreasing in size and slowing their fall,” they wrote. The volume of the speech, age of the speaker and dehydration of the oral cavity during breathing all play a role.",
            "“The amount by which a droplet shrinks upon dehydration depends on the fraction of nonvolatile matter in the oral fluid, which includes electrolytes, sugars, enzymes, DNA, and remnants of dehydrated epithelial and white blood cells. Whereas pure saliva contains 99.5% water when exiting the salivary glands, the weight fraction of nonvolatile matter in oral fluid falls in the 1% to 5% range.”",

You don’t get to pick and choose what children deserve your help at a time when millions of families are struggling, at least not in the eyes of the law. Thus, the federal government has intervened to make sure you fulfill your legal and your moral obligations.",
            "Also see: I received my ex-husband’s $1,200 stimulus check because we filed joint taxes in 2018. Should I give him the money or return it to the IRS?",
            "If you had supported your first child, the system would support you now. Why did you not pay your child support? Did you lose your job and do everything in your power to get another one to support both of your families? Did your business go under because of the pandemic? Of course, there are often extenuating circumstances where parents are simply unable to pay and, perhaps, don’t have an emergency fund for all eventualities. But if your instinct now is to steal, it gives me pause.",
            "“ Of course, there are often extenuating circumstances. But you have not given me a valid reason, or any reason for that matter, why you have not paid child support. ”",
            "Most of these EICs are being split 50/50 between two households. That seems fair. “If you are married filing jointly, and you filed an injured spouse claim with your 2019 tax return (or 2018 tax return if you haven’t filed your 2019 tax return), half of the total payment will be sent to each spouse and your spouse’s payment will be offset only for past-due child support,” according to the Internal Revenue Service. “There is no need to file another injured spouse claim for the payment.”",
            "Those parents listed on the Treasury Offset list for unpaid child support are liable, like you, to have their economic impact payment reduced or withheld. “Federal law requires child-support agencies to have procedures to collect past due child support from federal tax refunds,” according to Ken Paxton, the Attorney General of Texas. “In the federal stimulus bill, the CARES Act, Congress did not exempt the stimulus rebate payments from federal offsets for child-support arrears.”",
            "Dispatches from a pandemic:Letter from New York: ‘New Yorkers wear colorful homemade masks, while nurses wear garbage bags’",
            "In some cases the government has mistakenly withheld stimulus money from injured parties in child-support cases. The IRS said it's working with the Bureau of Fiscal Service, the Department of Health and Human Services and the Office of Child Support Enforcement to resolve this as soon as possible. Those parents who are owed child support and have not received their money may, indeed, feel rightly justified in holding their former spouses and the government responsible.",
            "You have not given me any valid reason, or any reason for that matter, why you have not paid child support. Instead, you lay the blame at the feet of the government. While no government is perfect, directing your anger at everyone else seems too simple a conclusion. In almost every situation, we all have to take some share — however large or small — of the responsibility. There’s an old saying: “When you take ‘bla, bla, bla’ out of ‘blame,’ you are left with ‘me.’",

            "Like many self-employed Americans, Andre Shakti has lost most of her income over the past few weeks.",
            "Most of the clients who used to see her in person have stopped calling, the business where she worked as an independent contractor is closed, and a conference she co-organizes has been canceled.",
            "But unlike most sole proprietors and independent contractors, Shakti says she’s not eligible for federal assistance under the $2.2 trillion CARES Act.",
            "“ It’s one of the few categories of businesses that are banned from receiving federal aid under the CARES Act. Others include cannabis firms and businesses deriving over 50% of their revenue from gambling. ”",
            "That’s because she’s a sex worker.",
            "Shakti, who works as a stripper, dominatrix and sex educator, says Small Business Administration programs aimed at helping small businesses, including independent contractors and sole proprietorships, survive the COVID-19 pandemic aren’t available to her because businesses that provide services or live performances of a “prurient sexual nature” are banned from receiving SBA loans under federal regulations.",
            "Shakti, who graduated from college in 2011, says she still has student-loan debt and also contributes to supporting her father, who lives in an assisted-living facility. In college, Shakti majored in deaf studies and psychology with a minor in LGBTQ studies. At one point, she says, she thought about becoming an American Sign Language interpreter.",
            "“My sister and I share his monthly rent, which is $2,300 a month,” she says. “I had to have a really serious conversation with my family about what my financial situation was going to be in the future, and I had to dock the amount of money that I was able to give my father, and my mother had to step in. She’s pretty low-income, and that honestly concerns me a lot.”",
            "At least two strip clubs are suing the SBA after being denied Paycheck Protection Program loans, and at least one sex-toy manufacturer was denied an SBA loan in the past because of the “prurient sexual nature” clause.",
            "The CARES Act’s ban on businesses of a “prurient sexual nature\" isn’t limited to the new SBA loans that were introduced in the CARES Act; it applies to the SBA’s existing business-loan programs, as well.",
            "Market research firm IBISWorld estimates that strip clubs in the U.S. generated $8 billion in revenue in 2019 and, before the coronavirus, expected the industry to grow at an annualized rate of 4.2%. “Proprietors within the strip clubs industry distanced themselves from the seedy past image associated with clubs,” it said. “Instead, they marketed their establishments as high-class gentlemen’s clubs and cocktail lounges that offer adult entertainment.”",
            "SBA’s standard operating procedure for business loans states that a business is not eligible if “it presents live or recorded performances of a prurient sexual nature” or “derives more than 5% of its gross revenue, directly or indirectly, through the sale of products, services or the presentation of any depictions or displays of a prurient sexual nature.”",
            "The SBA did not respond to a request for comment on the definition it uses for “prurient sexual nature.”",
            "“ Andre Shakti says she’s lost around two-thirds of her income since the end of February, when her dominatrix clients started canceling and customers stopped going to the strip club. ”",
            "It’s one of the few categories of businesses banned from receiving federal aid under the CARES Act.",
            "Others include businesses that sell products that are illegal at the federal level, like cannabis.",
            "(However, on April 28 the Small Business Administration did reverse its original stance disallowing casinos and other gaming establishments from getting Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) money. The SBA said a business otherwise eligible for a PPP Loan would no longer be left out because of legal gaming revenues. “On further consideration, the administrator, in consultation with the [Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin], believes this approach is more consistent with the policy aim of making PPP loans available to a broad segment of U.S. businesses,” the SBA said.)",
            "Unemployment benefits have been extended to self-employed workers by the CARES Act, but most states — including Maryland, where Shakti lives — were delayed in accepting applications from self-employed workers. Maryland said it would start accepting those applications on April 24.",
            "Much of Shakti’s income requires travel, she says. She regularly speaks at conferences across the country about sexual health and pleasure-related topics, she says. While traveling, she works as a dominatrix, seeing local clients at her hotel, and performs at strip clubs.",
            "Shakti, who works as an independent contractor for strip clubs and as sole proprietor of her dominatrix business, makes between $40,000 and $50,000 in an average year and says she pays her taxes.",
            "In total, Shakti says she’s lost around two-thirds of her income since the end of February, when her dominatrix clients started canceling and customers stopped going to the strip club.",
            "“The week and a half [or] two weeks before we closed, it was dead in there,” she says. “I was gradually making less and less and less until everything shut down.”",
            "Compared with some of her colleagues, Shakti says she’s well-positioned to move some of her business online. She’s built an online fan base through her work as a adult film performer and some less explicit aspects of her businesses, like providing intimacy consulting to individuals, couples and people in nonmonogamous relationships.",
            "“ Shakti says she still has student-loan debt nearly a decade after graduation and also contributes to supporting her father in an assisted-living facility. ”",
            "She says she addresses topics including “sexual confidence, intimacy after trauma, exploring kink and BDSM, opening up a pre-existing monogamous relationship and transitioning into or out of the sex industry.” That, she adds, can also be done remotely.",
            "“I do consider myself to be in a very privileged space, but, at the same time, I saw an in-person client two days ago,” she says. “It was the first time I’ve seen a client since I’ve been quarantined for four weeks, but I have a mortgage to pay and I was scared about not being able to pay for it.”",
            "Shakti says she believes that banning businesses that offer services of a “prurient sexual nature” from receiving federal assistance is a “targeted attack” on sex workers.",
            "“It’s basically putting a financial death date on all these workers,” she says.",
            "“ International organizations, including projects funded by the U.S. government, have warned that restrictions designed to stem the spread of COVID-19 could disproportionately affect sex workers. ”",
            "Workers from marginalized communities and single mothers will be particularly affected, she says.",
            "International organizations, as well as projects funded by the U.S. government, have warned that COVID-19 — and the physical distancing efforts intended to stop its spread — could disproportionately affect sex workers.",
            "“Many will have fewer clients, increasing the risk of homelessness and the need to accept riskier clients. The closing of bars and other hot spots may also cause sex workers to move from a more protected environment to street-based activities,” according to a report published by Meeting Targets and Maintaining Epidemic Control, an AIDS relief project funded by the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief and the U.S. Agency for International Development.",
            "Organizations that work with sex workers in Canada have warned that physical-distancing measures are also making it difficult for sex workers to work out of their homes, and made it more likely that those who work on the street will be arrested by the police.",
            "“Sex workers are heavily affected by measures such as social distancing and business shutdowns because they simply cannot go to their workplaces anymore, and are seeing a sharp decrease in their clients. Unlike employees from ‘mainstream’ businesses, many sex workers are not eligible for unemployment benefits,” says Lynn Liu, the development and communications associate at the Sex Workers Project at the Urban Justice Center in New York City.",
            "“Transgender sex workers and migrant sex workers of color are especially vulnerable to this because many are already job- or housing-insecure,” she says, with a third of sex workers identified as African American or black, 17% identified as Caucasian, 11% as Latino or Latina, and 8% as multiracial; 30% did not identify a race or ethnicity. Some 78% identified as women, 3% as men and 19% as transgender women.",
            "“In New York, sex workers come from very diverse backgrounds. There are transgender sex workers, migrant sex workers, sex workers of color, as well as cisgender white sex workers who are in a more privileged position,” says Liu.",
            "Liu says she thinks it’s “deeply problematic” that sex workers are ineligible for financial support from the government.",
            "“Sex workers’ rights are human rights. In a global pandemic like this, the government should implement policies that take everyone’s well-being into account,” she says. “Especially the well-being of marginalized groups.”",
            "“ ‘The way that I heal that is through education and then creating a safe space for people to enter, either physically or remotely, where they know that within this space they are going to be loved and accepted.’ ”",
            "Shakti says she doesn’t just miss her regular income; she also misses her work. “I love the work that I do. I love every single part of it,” she says.",
            "Shakti, who says she started going to strip clubs when she was 18, says she misses the environment and her colleagues. “I know that people have all kinds of different desires, including ones that are considered alternatives from our mainstream, like kink, BDSM, and that they grow up with so much shame around it,” she says.",
            "“What I want to do is to help heal that, and the way that I heal that is through education and then creating a safe space for people to enter, either physically or remotely, where they know that within this space they are going to be loved and accepted and encouraged, not [just] tolerated or demeaned,” she added.",
            "Not every sex-related business believes its products or services are of a “prurient sexual nature.”",
            "Mike Stabile, the communications director for the Free Speech Coalition, a trade association that represents the pornography and adult entertainment industry, says his group takes a more narrow reading of the ban. “Historically and legally, prurient is a very, very narrow term and is not something that necessarily applies to run-of-the-mill adult content,” he says. “Traditionally, [the word] prurient describes a shameful or morbid interest in sex or sexuality. For most of our members, and for most people who enjoy adult content, that’s not how we would describe it. I think we look at what we do, in general, as natural and healthy.”",
            "“ Evy Cowan and Jeneen Doumitt, the owners of She Bop, a sex-toy store with two locations in Portland, Ore., say they’ve applied for an Economic Injury Disaster Loan from the SBA. ”",
            "But, he says, his group can’t advise any individual company about what they should tell the SBA.",
            "“We don’t necessarily know what every business does nor whether or not, if a case went to court, their content would be found prurient or obscene — that’s something that no organization can determine,” he says.",
            "Still, some businesses are trying their chances.",
            "Evy Cowan and Jeneen Doumitt, the owners of She Bop, a sex-toy store with two locations in Portland, Ore., say they’ve applied for an Economic Injury Disaster Loan from the SBA. They’ve had to shutter their storefronts and lay off seven employees because of the pandemic, Doumitt says.",
            "She Bop has been in business for more than a decade, but Cowan says several banks have refused to do business with the store because of the products it sells. Securing financing has been almost impossible.",
            "While the word prurient gave Cowan and Doumitt pause, the pair decided to apply for the loan after they looked the word up and saw it defined as “having or encouraging an excessive interest in sexual matters.”",
            "“We laughed about it and tried to figure out how to say it properly and rationalized that we didn’t feel we were encouraging ‘excessive interest in sexual matters’ — we were encouraging just the right amount of interest in sexual matters,” Cowan says.",
            "They haven’t heard back.",

But most agree that returning students to school buildings safely is a complicated proposition that comes with high stakes.",

            "Eskelsen García, a former school lunch lady and sixth-grade teacher, called schools “a germ factory” that not only put at risk teachers, counselors and school support staff, but also kids’ families. “These kids will catch it from each other, and they will take it home,” she said. “That means that they can be a danger to older brothers and sisters ... their own parents, and, Lord help me, their grandparents.”",
            "“ ‘Kids in school can quickly widen your circle of people that you’re exposed to. A lot of that is because kids aren’t as good about social distancing as adults are.’ ”",
            "This coronavirus doesn’t appear to impact children as severely as it does other age groups. But “kids surely are a part of this pandemic,” Aaron Milstone, a professor of pediatric infectious diseases and epidemiology at Johns Hopkins Medicine, told MarketWatch. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say that children “can still pass this virus onto others who may be at higher risk,” and new research suggests kids can indeed transmit COVID-19.",
            "Health officials are also investigating cases of a rare but potentially life-threatening condition in kids called pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome (PMIS), which could be related to COVID-19.",
            "Once children go back to school, Milstone said, their exposure to classmates will expand their families’ social networks. No matter how careful you are in your own actions, “kids in school can quickly widen your circle of people that you’re exposed to,” he said. “A lot of that is because kids aren’t as good about social distancing as adults are.”",
            "But physically distancing 30-some children in a regular-sized classroom won’t be feasible, said Eskelsen García, who recalled getting sneezed on and hugged when she was a teacher.",
            "“Teachers who know how physically close it is in that classroom are saying, ‘We’re not saying we can’t do it — we’re saying it’s going to take a lot of time and it’s going to take a lot of resources,’” she said. “I think we will go back, and it will not look anything like it looked when we left that building.”",
            "The American Federation of Teachers released a 22-page road map in late April for safely reopening schools and communities, starting with a decline in the number of new cases for at least 14 straight days.",
            "“ The American Federation of Teachers released a 22-page road map in late April for safely reopening schools, starting with a decline in the number of new cases for at least 14 straight days. ”",
            "Its recommendations included ramped-up testing and contact tracing, hand-washing stations, symptom screening for kids and staff, daily school sanitization, personal protective equipment (PPE) for teachers and support staff, and additional funding for these interventions; they also called for protections for at-risk staff and students, as well as considerations for students with underlying conditions, disabilities and special-education requirements.",
            "The labor union laid out a number of school-reorganization solutions to promote physical distancing, including smaller class sizes; split scheduling to limit the number of students present inside the building; and staggered arrival times and meal times, with students potentially eating in classrooms. Eskelsen García said she had also heard the idea of opening schools to younger students while older kids learn from home independently.",
            "Miami-Dade County Public Schools superintendent Alberto Carvalho, who oversees the nation’s fourth-largest school district, told MarketWatch his district was currently evaluating a number of contingency plans to keep staff and students safe, including temperature checks before boarding buses or entering buildings, gyms and auditoriums leveraged to create additional classroom space, hallways redesigned to flow one way, and mandatory hand-washing schedules. The district is building up its PPE stock in preparation, he added.",
            "“There are so many variables right now at play that the best that rational leaders can do is take in all of the data, develop multiple scenarios, and be able to pivot to one depending on shifting conditions,” he said.",
            "“ ‘There are some very, very creative ways that people have talked about doing this — none of them come without a big price tag.’ ”",
            "New York mayor Bill de Blasio, meanwhile, told reporters Monday that contingencies to his “Plan A” of fully reopening schools in September included alternating days, staggered schedules and even purely online learning, according to Politico.",
            "“All of this takes planning,” Randi Weingarten, the head of the American Federation of Teachers, told MarketWatch. “It takes planning to think through the models for physical distancing. … It takes planning to ensure that schools are cleaned [after] each of these sessions. It takes planning to make sure that you have the hand-washing stations and that you have enough PPE like masks.”",
            "While school administrators are rightly concerned about protecting students’ health and safety and catching them up on curriculum, they must also contend with the varying degrees of trauma students will have endured from the pandemic, Eskelsen García said.",
            "“Fear and uncertainty and anxiety over a prolonged period of time causes stress and causes trauma,” she said. “We’ll be having to deal with those mental-health issues alongside dealing with long division and where the comma goes.”",
            "In the absence of broad COVID-19 testing for tens of millions of schoolchildren on a regular basis, school administrators will likely have to rely on other measures such as symptom screening, social distancing, hand-washing, school cleaning and other basic practices, Milstone said.",
            "To that end, the CDC last week released a one-page series of flow charts to aid K-12 administrators in their reopening decisions, with recommendations for health and safety precautions and ongoing monitoring.",
            "“ ‘The White House has watered down the CDC guidelines to nothing more than a flimsy flowchart.’ ”",
            "But Daniel Domenech, the executive director of the School Superintendents Association (AASA), called the decision trees “underwhelming,” telling U.S. News and World Report that his members found lengthier CDC guidelines leaked to the Associated Press and reportedly shelved by the Trump administration to be more helpful.",
            "Weingarten said in a letter sent to President Trump last week that educators were “still without clear guidance and support from the White House or your administration,” and asked the president to “work with us, not against us.” In a statement Monday, Eskelsen García said, “The White House has watered down the CDC guidelines to nothing more than a flimsy flowchart.”",
            "Asked for comment on the criticisms leveled by Domenech and Weingarten, as well as on whether it planned to release more comprehensive guidelines for schools to reopen, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany told MarketWatch on Friday: “President Trump has issued clear, data-driven guidance on how states can reopen while acknowledging that reopening decisions ultimately rest with governors. President Trump has likewise been clear that he would like to see schools reopen in a safe manner.”",
            "On Monday, a CDC spokeswoman directed MarketWatch to a document entitled “CDC Activities and Initiatives Supporting the COVID-19 Response and the President’s Plan for Opening America Up Again,” which she said had been updated with two new appendices.",
            "One appendix provides additional detail on the “gating criteria” described in the president’s reopening plan, she said, while the other “is a supplement to the decision trees released May 14, listing specific practices that schools and other settings may find helpful at particular stages of the COVID-19 outbreak.”",
            "“These critical resources complement other guidance CDC has previously released to help communities plan for, respond to, and recover from COVID-19,” the spokeswoman said. “CDC will continue to update these resources to help state and local leaders as they implement, adapt, and adjust COVID-19 mitigation strategies in their communities.”",
            "Plans to keep students educated while preventing the spread of COVID-19 will also require money, said Eskelsen García, whose union is advocating for legislation to increase funding for public schools. “There are very few public schools that have a lot of empty classrooms or empty spaces and class sizes of a dozen kids,” she said. “There are some very, very creative ways that people have talked about doing this — none of them come without a big price tag.”",
            "In an April 28 letter to congressional leaders, superintendents from 62 major city school districts called for additional funding for public school systems in the next COVID-19 relief bill, citing “significant revenue shortfalls” on the horizon for local school districts.",
            "“ K-12 schools’ potential new normal could also exacerbate existing inequalities between rich and poor school districts. ”",
            "Carvalho, one of the letter’s signatories, said he was “concerned” about funding during a time when his district needed to invest in extra protections for students and staff.",
            "“We are dealing not only with the possibility of an economic recession with significant loss of revenues that fund education, but we’re dealing at the same time [with the fact] that we have to spend additional resources on protective measures to deal with a health crisis,” he said.",
            "K-12 schools’ potential new normal could also exacerbate existing inequalities between rich and poor school districts, said Julian Vasquez Heilig, the dean of the University of Kentucky’s College of Education, as “recent school finance research has established that rich and poor districts already have hundreds millions of dollars in inequity in terms of funding from all sources.”",
            "“The availability of resources in rich and poor districts directly impacts the ability of the district to offer smaller class sizes in socially distanced classrooms, flexibility of facilities for alternative modes of instruction, availability of technology for distance learning and alternative modes of instruction, availability of PPE for students, staff and faculty and most other circumstance related to COVID-19 responses,” Vasquez Heilig told MarketWatch.",
            "Carvalho said he was also concerned about students whose parents’ jobs prevented them from being able to supervise their kids during the day for remote learning, as well as food-insecure children who relied on school meals.",
            "The crisis presents “an unfortunately good opportunity for us to rethink education,” said Yong Zhao, a distinguished professor at University of Kansas’s School of Education, with a shift away from standardized testing and a greater emphasis on supporting students’ individual growth.",
            "Carvalho, meanwhile, said “there’s no going back to the way things used to be” — predicting the education system would become far more personalized, adaptive and flexible to students’ and families’ needs. Some parents might decide to send their kids to school for the full school day, he said, while other families might decide distance learning works well for them, and still others might opt for in-person instruction on alternate days.",
            "“There will be traditional schooling side-by-side with multiple options that reflect the wants and wishes of parents, learning modalities of kids, and blended and hybrid learning environments across the board,” Carvalho said. “While we may have some concerns about it — and I certainly do — there is also an opportunity here.”"

            "It’s safe to say college will be a very different experience for students this fall than what they imagined. But right now, that’s pretty much all they can be sure of.",
            "As the coronavirus pandemic swept the country this spring, colleges almost uniformly moved students from lecture halls and dorms to virtual classrooms and quarters cramped with family. But with the fall semester looming, college officials’ plans are varying widely.",
            "The California State University system plans to deliver classes primarily online for fall 2020. At the University of Notre Dame, officials are planning for students to return to campus on August 10 — two weeks earlier than typical — and for them to continue without breaks until Thanksgiving. The fall semester will begin as scheduled on Aug. 26 at the University of Texas at Austin, and classes will run until Thanksgiving. Students will not return after Thanksgiving and, instead, will participate in reading days and final exams remotely. New York University and Boston College have said they intend to open their campuses this fall, subject to government health directives.",
            "See also: ‘There will be less patience in the fall’: 100 ‘unprecedented’ student lawsuits suing colleges amid coronavirus outbreak",
            "Overall, roughly 68% of colleges are planning for in-person instruction this fall, compared to 6% who are planning for an online fall semester and 6% who have said they would do some kind of hybrid, according to the Chronicle of Higher Education, which is tracking these announcements.",
            "But students could face a long wait for definitive answers on how their fall will look. Many colleges are likely avoiding big pronouncements about their plans as a way to sustain enrollment, said Catherine Bond Hill, managing director at Ithaka S + R, which consults with universities and nonprofits, and the president emerita of Vassar College. If families get wind that their college is going solely online in the fall, students may be hesitant to enroll.",
            "When students and faculty scattered in the spring, “everybody was hopeful things would be back to normal in the summer and that things would be back to normal in the fall,” she said. “The reality is that we just don’t know enough yet.”",
            "Given that uncertainty, “the only decision you can really make now that you can commit to is that you’re going to be online,” she said.",
            "Are you a student or parent thinking about your college plans for the fall? We want to hear from you. Email jberman@marketwatch.com",
            "As college officials weigh their options, they’re considering a variety of factors. Of course, the health and safety of their students, faculty and staff is top of mind, but finances are also likely playing a role. If a college chooses to go online and loses students as a result, they also lose the revenue that comes with them. Even if students do still enroll in an online environment, the schools will forgo the money they receive from residence halls and dining facilities. At the same time, taking the precautions necessary to open up safely will also be costly.",
            "“One of the greatest things about a university is that it’s a living and a learning environment for students who come from all over, internally and nationally, and they live, and work, and play on a campus,” said Jean Chin, an associate clinical professor of medicine at the University of Georgia, who is also chairing the American College Health Association’s COVID-19 task force. “It’s one of the great challenges too because this virus requires you to be physically distant from each other.”",
            "Lawrence Schovanec, the president of Texas Tech University, is in the process of nailing down the details of a physically distant, in-person university experience. He announced last month that Texas Tech will be doing a phased-in return to campus this fall.",
            "“It’s not going to be the same experience they left in the spring,” he said. Schovanec and other officials are working through the specifics of what that will look like. They’re considering issues ranging from how to move pedestrians through campus without crowding, to whether to adjust dismissal times for classes to reduce the number of people walking through hallways at once, to how they might deal with residence halls. As of last week, dorms looked like they would be booked to nearly 100% capacity, but “we can’t have that,” Schovanec said.",
            "The school has already determined protocols for how it will let researchers back to campus — there will be temperature checks and closed water fountains, among other restrictions — but officials are still not yet sure what exactly the experience will be like for students. Texas Tech’s provost solicited from every department details on how they plan to deliver their courses and how the school proceeds will depend in part on those plans.",
            "Right now, Schovanec said he expects that 25% of the courses offered will be face-to-face, about 25% will be offered purely online and 50% will be offered in some kind of hybrid. “You have to look at every classroom and we’re allowing a certain number of square feet per student,” he said. “If you were to do that and comply with CDC guidelines a rough estimate would be that we would be at 25% capacity of the room.”",
            "The idea that students might choose not to enroll at Texas Tech for the semester if the school went fully online in the fall factored into the school’s plans, Schovanec said. “I believe that when students choose an institution they become tied to an institution by virtue of the culture of that institution, not just what happens in the classroom and that culture is developed and conveyed through personal interactions,” he said. “I heard from students and from parents, ‘I didn’t choose Texas Tech to sit at home to be taking online courses.’”",
            "The school is projected to lose an estimated $20 million in revenue this spring and summer because of the move to a virtual-only campus. Most of the loss is related to not charging fees associated with being on campus. Enrollment numbers currently appear strong and the school has budgeted for enrollment decreases, but a drop of more than 20% would require the school to take “drastic measures,” Schovanec said. He said he’s also cognizant that some parents may be hesitant to send their students to school in this environment, which is why officials are thinking through how they plan to communicate their safety plans to families.",
            "For years, colleges have been under financial pressure thanks to losses in state funding, demographic trends that portend declining enrollment, and other factors. The pandemic has exacerbated those challenges, said Robert Kelchen, an associate professor of higher education at Seton Hall University. Colleges are likely to be forgoing tuition revenue and losing out on state funding and fundraising as the economic devastation from the pandemic continues. Colleges have a financial incentive to open up to counter the losses they’ve already experienced and likely will continue to see, Kelchen said.",
            "But opening up schools safely will be costly too. Chin’s task force has offered schools a slew of recommendations for reopening that include access to potentially expensive testing supplies, masks, and physical changes to facilities, like installing plexi-glass walls around some public desks. To open safely, colleges will also need space to isolate infected students or employees.",
            "Other costs could include cleaning facilities, hiring more faculty to help reduce class sizes, and extending hours for research labs so that employees can stagger their time, Kelchen said. “All of those little unseen costs,” he said. Schovanec said he’s not yet sure of the costs of the safety measures his school will take. “When it comes to these issues that relate to safety we suspend the concern of the cost,” he said."

We had no idea how long this was going to last.",
            "I thought of my brother’s offer. “Let’s accept,” I said. My husband surprised me by agreeing.",

At the time, there were fewer than 20 confirmed cases in all of Rhode Island. From my window, I watched people walking their dogs and jogging; parents pushing strollers. How would our friends and neighbors react? Would they fear us?",
            "I trained as a historian of Medieval Italy in the period of the Black Death, when the idea of quarantine as a social practice first emerged. In the late 1300s, cities with ports — the most important of which was Venice — began fighting the spread of disease by requiring arriving merchant ships to remain docked in port. This was initially a 30-day period, called trentino, from the Italian word for 30, but eventually became solidified in practice as quarantina, from the Italian word for 40.",

            "For me, “quarantine” had always conjured images of these isolated ships teeming with rats, and of marooned sailors whose bodies were wracked by scurvy or the boils of bubonic plague. Did a 21st-century version of this await my family?",
            "As I pondered the possibility, my phone pinged with a text. My brother had dropped off the bolognese, as well as chocolate-chip cookies his wife had made: salted on top, her specialty. One neighbor made an impromptu visit and left us groceries, while another left flowers and books. We accepted their offerings, always from a distance, with gratitude. Our ship was moored offshore, but few seemed deterred from rowing over to toss us sustenance from a safe distance.",

            "The second day was the hardest. I was roiled with fever and intense body aches; my right leg thrummed from top to bottom and my back felt like it was in spasm. My head was on the verge of exploding and my cough had turned from dry to wet.",
            "Amid all this, the offerings of friends, family and neighbors kept rolling in over the next few days: homemade bread, a bouquet of wildflowers and assortments of herbal teas, Portuguese rolls, cupcakes and chocolates, a “soup to raise the dead,” a pile of books, a rum cake that friends assured us they had “prepared with gloves.”",
            "I had tested positive for a scary virus, and suddenly our whole world was reaching out.",
            "Even old acquaintances were showing up. The assistant midwife from my younger son’s birth nearly a decade ago texted, “We’re getting a Whole Foods AMZN, -0.40% delivery tomorrow. Can we add anything for you?” She and her toddler are immunocompromised and live 20 minutes away. The pure generosity of her offer stunned me.",
            "The Rhode Island Department of Health, which was barely on my radar before I fell ill, remained in constant contact. The female staffer who called to check my symptoms remembered me and addressed me as “honey.”",

            "All this, despite my “moderate” case of coronavirus. Although I was bedridden for two weeks, I did not experience the dreaded labored breathing or any extreme symptoms of this terrible disease. I was, however, exhausted, feverish and wracked with sinus headaches and body aches. I was separated from my children and husband and left to lie on a couch while others worked, like a Victorian woman with a fainting problem.",

            "Things would not remain so simple. A week after I fell ill with COVID-19, my husband also developed symptoms consistent with the disease.",
            "At first, we thought he was exhausted from all the work of preparing food, settling disputes and helping the kids navigate their new virtual school day, while simultaneously managing his own ongoing professional responsibilities. We surmised, too, that he was depleted from the emotional toll of reading about his hometown of Madrid and its terrible COVID-19 death toll; that waves of grief and worry for his aging parents, for his siblings who work in professions that bring them into close contact with the sick, had simply worn him down.",
            "But we knew we had a problem when one evening, dinner tray in hand, he reached the top of the stairs and declared he needed to rest. My husband is the kind of person who climbs 4,000-meter mountains for fun. Not long ago, he climbed the Matterhorn, for God’s sake. Climbing the 29 steps to our third floor should not have been a challenge for him. It should not even have been a warm-up.",
            "We will likely never know with certainty whether or not my husband has the disease. Difficult decisions have arisen: Who should take care of our boys? Which one of us should prepare food? Whose rest is more important? No one can enter our home — we are on our own. The image of the pestilent ship has begun to loom larger, and it takes work to push it away.",
            "I called the health department for advice. “You both need to be in isolation, separately,” the staffer said. “And our kids?” I asked. There was a long silence. “I think you need to call your doctor,” she eventually said.",

            "The following day, my husband had a long conversation with his physician. Assessing who should do what, and when, seemed to involve complex mathematical equations involving probability, adjusted for age and sex, and weighed against average periods of contagion and recovery. The conclusion: I would take over most responsibilities, and my husband would prioritize getting much-needed rest.",
            "During this more difficult period, offerings from friends, family, and neighbors have continued flowing in. At first, I marveled at how much people cared. I wondered whether we deserved it. But I have come to realize that the generosity we have experienced is about more than just us. In part because of lack of testing, and in part because our state is small, Rhode Island has seen a steady increase in the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19. As of Sunday there were at least 13,952 confirmed cases in the state, and 597 deaths.",

            "News of the spreading virus, and the many varieties of devastation it has provoked, have left all of us desperate to help. But it seems all we can do is wash our hands, stay at home and resist hoarding supplies. These actions, while vital, do not feel heroic. In the face of the coronavirus, we all feel small and more than a little helpless.",
            "Many lament the isolation of modern American life. But in this moment, what I have seen from my window is a community waiting to be mobilized. People at home are looking for opportunities to do tangible good. For a while, my family was the object of their desire to help. Tomorrow, rightfully, it will be someone else.",
            "I, too, have found ways of offering sustenance to others moored around me. In the past weeks, a handful of strangers from around the country — friends of friends — have called to talk about their symptoms, to compare them to what I experienced. “Do you think I have it?” they ask. They cannot access tests, and of course I do not know. All I can offer is understanding and reassurance, based on my own example, that perhaps they will be OK. The connection I feel with them, and the knowledge that we are all in this together, is real.",
            "As the days pass, each one marked by increasingly grim body counts, we feel the ring around us tightening. COVID-19 is almost certainly spreading through our community. In coming weeks, the feeling of helplessness is likely to deepen. But, as an early COVID-19 case in my area, I have seen firsthand the power of a community poised to help.",

            "This experience has taught me that while the sustenance is important in itself, an offering on your doorstep is more than just food. It is a visible rendering of the rope that connects us to one another, the rope that stabilizes our lonely ships and gives us — singly and collectively — the courage to wait out this storm.",

            "Christopher Wells believes his employer didn’t have any business seeing his mother’s COVID-19 test results. Now he’s out of a job and suing his prior company, alleging wrongful termination.",
            "In a case highlighting thorny issues on medical privacy and public health during the coronavirus outbreak, Wells filed a lawsuit earlier this month alleging Enterprise Rent-A-Car went too far by asking him to relay results about his mother’s coronavirus test.",
            "“I felt violated and I felt I didn’t have a fair shot at securing my job,” Wells, 28, said in an interview. The Virginia Beach man’s Norfolk Circuit Court lawsuit is seeking $450,000 in damages.",
            "“ ‘I also asked that you follow up with your family member and keep me posted on your status, as well as your family member test results.’ ”",
            "While the case works its way through court — like so many others related to the outbreak — companies are grappling with how they can safely bring back workers and customers. More than one-third of approximately 750 companies said one tactic will be COVID-19 screenings and assessments, according to a survey from Mercer, a human resources consulting firm.",
            "Enterprise told MarketWatch that “now more than ever,” safeguarding worker and customer health was the company’s top priority. Wells and his lawyer say they understand that concern, but allege the company went about it the wrong way in this instance.",
            "Wells was working as a management assistant in a Williamsburg branch for just over a year, making approximately $44,000 a year — as well as between $12,000 to $15,000 by waiting tables on the side.",
            "In mid-March, he saw his mother at his sister’s birthday party. His mother left early and didn’t dance, which wasn’t like her, Wells noted.",
            "A doctor later diagnosed her with the flu and an upper respiratory infection, Wells said. Though she ultimately got a COVID-19 test, Wells said she has not shared the results with him. (He said his mom is better now and the pair do virtual fitness classes together, he noted to MarketWatch.)",
            "Dispatches from a pandemic: Letter from New York: ‘When I hear an ambulance, I wonder if there’s a coronavirus patient inside. Are there more 911 calls, or do I notice every distant siren?’",
            "Wells said he told his bosses at the time that his mother wasn’t feeling well, but they didn’t tell him to self-isolate or take other precautionary steps.",
            "That changed at the end of March when the company received an anonymous call from a person alleging Wells may have been exposed to the virus, according to the lawsuit.",
            "A human resources official told Wells to get tested, and, in an April 2 termination letter, said he was refusing to get tested. “I also asked that you follow up with your family member and keep me posted on your status, as well as your family member test results,” the letter said, noting it had been difficult to get a hold of Wells.",
            "“ ‘The health and safety of our employees and customers is our No. 1 priority. We do not have any further comment on this specific case at this time.’ ”",
            "Wells said at one point he lost his sense of taste and smell. At the time, he attributed it to allergies, he told MarketWatch. After Wells told company officials, he was taken off a shift and advised to contact his medical provider, the letter noted.",
            "In late April, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention added the new loss of taste or smell as a potential symptom for coronavirus infection.",
            "The termination letter said Wells was being “reckless given the current pandemic,” and fired him for “gross insubordination.”",
            "Wells and his attorney say he wasn’t refusing a test. He was planning to get a test on his upcoming week off, but he was fired before getting a chance.",
            "“I just don’t know you can necessarily demand people to turn over family health records. I think that’s obviously a step too far,” said Wells’ attorney, Barry Montgomery of Kalbaugh, Pfund & Messersmith in Richmond, Va.",
            "“Now more than ever, the health and safety of our employees and customers is our No. 1 priority. We do not have any further comment on this specific case at this time,” an Enterprise spokeswoman told MarketWatch.",
            "Wells, now out of a job, never ending up getting a test. He said as he looked into getting a test, but maintains that he didn’t fit the criteria to get testing because he didn’t have enough symptoms.",
            "Wells’ lawsuit says he was fired for refusing to go along with Enterprise’s request and alleges that his former company violated Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) privacy laws that protect his mother’s medical records.",
            "“ ‘As Americans return to work, they may discover that they have very few legal protections against requests for medical information from their employers.’ ”",
            "Employers do have the right to take a worker’s temperature and ban workers who refuse temperature checks or won’t answer questions about whether they have COVID-19 symptoms or have been tested, according to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, a federal regulator.",
            "But the EEOC advises companies to avoid questions about a family members.",
            "When MarketWatch asked about companies seeking information about a worker’s relatives, an EEOC spokeswoman cited a recent agency presentation.",
            "There, Sharon Rennert, senior attorney adviser, said the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) “prohibits employers from asking employees medical questions about family members.”",
            "According to Rennert’s presentation in late March, “A better question from a public-health and workforce management perspective is whether an individual has had contact with anyone who the employee knows has been diagnosed with COVID-19, or who may have symptoms associated with the disease. From EEOC’s perspective, this general question is more sound.”",
            "Don’t miss:‘Opening up does not mean social activities’: Your coronavirus guide to safely commuting, shopping, traveling and visiting the doctor as states reopen",
            "Professor Jessica Roberts, who specializes in genetics and disability law at the University of Houston Law Center, says the current legal landscape is not so clear cut.",
            "The medical privacy protections in Wells’ suit might not apply, and a law like GINA might not cover the case too, in Roberts’ view. The law forbids probing into a worker’s family medical history, but based on her interpretations of past court decisions, Roberts said it’s not clear that coronavirus test results would count.",
            "“Unfortunately, as Americans return to work, they may discover that they have very few legal protections against requests for medical information from their employers,” said Roberts, the author of “Healthism: Health-Status Discrimination and the Law.”",
            "“I think this is a difficult case to win under the current federal law, at least as I understand it,” Roberts said.",
            "Back in Virginia, Montgomery said HIPAA medical privacy laws could be used. If a doctor or health-care provider made an unauthorized disclosure of patient information, they could be liable, he said. Enterprise was allegedly trying to make Wells assist with the disclosure, Montgomery said.",
            "Meanwhile, Wells is planning ahead. He’s lost his Enterprise job, and his waiter job after the restaurant closed. He planned to buy a condominium apartment, but the plans were cancelled after losing his job.",
            "When Wells’ lease is up at the end of June, he’s planning to move in with his brother, adding, “I can no longer afford my life.”"

            "The COVID-19 pandemic demanded quick and drastic federal government intervention to save jobs and keep the economy from going into a total tailspin. But the legislative process was quick and dirty — with all the inevitable errors, omissions, and unintended consequences.",
            "You know that’s true when the Los Angeles Lakers and the Ruth’s Chris Steak House chain qualified for potentially forgivable “emergency loans” under the Small Business Administration’s Paycheck Protection Program (PPP). The Lakers got $4.6 million for their “emergency” and Ruth’s Chris got a cool $20 million. While the Lakers and Ruth’s Chris Steak House paid back their PPP loans, it was only after attention from the media. Good grief. We can certainly do better with the next round(s) of COVID-19 relief.",
            "“The Lakers qualified for and received a loan under the Payroll Protection Program,” the Lakers said in a statement last month. “Once we found out the funds from the program had been depleted, we repaid the loan so that financial support would be directed to those most in need. The Lakers remain completely committed to supporting both our employees and our community.”",
            "“We intended to repay this loan in adherence with government guidelines, but as we learned more about the funding limitations of the program and the unintended impact, we have decided to accelerate that repayment,” Cheryl Henry, President and Chief Executive of Ruth’s Hospitality Group, which owns Ruth’s Chris Steak House, said in a statement.",
            "More than 230 received over $1 billion in PPP loans, according to an analysis of public filings through April 27, The Wall Street Journal reported. At least 30 public companies with market capitalizations of between $4.5 million and $560 million have said they’d keep more than $100 million in total, the paper reported. The Treasury Department ruled that companies with access to other sources of capital are not qualified to receive PPP loans.",
            "Since I’m just a tax guy, let’s focus on federal tax changes that would allow us to do better. Here are some suggestions.",
            "Businesses small and large need more financial relief, including more tax relief. But let’s direct any new tax relief to where it will do the most good. For instance:",
            "Under our current federal payroll tax regime, owners of businesses that are treated as sole proprietorships and spousal partnerships for tax purposes can hire their under-age-18 children, and the children’s wages are exempt from Social Security, Medicare and federal unemployment (FUTA) taxes. For details, see this previous Tax Guy column.",
            "Great. Right now, hiring your kids and keeping money in the family could be a financial life preserver. The no-federal-payroll-taxes break is an added and valuable bonus. And we are looking for more ways to help family businesses. Right? So, let’s temporarily extend the no-federal-payroll taxes deal to cover under-age-25 children. That could help more family business owners and their offspring stay on their feet.",
            "Under our current federal income tax regime, businesses that spend money on so-called qualified improvement property (QIP) can write off the entire amount in Year One. That’s because QIP expenditures are eligible for 100% first-year bonus depreciation through the end of 2022. Great. However, the Tax Code currently defines QIP as the cost of an improvement to an interior portion of a nonresidential building — excluding expenditures for the enlargement or internal structural framework of the building. That’s a very limiting definition. Many buildings will need to be re-purposed in response to COVID-19, and many things may need to be done on the outside.",
            "• Think converting square footage formerly occupied by a large retail store into a large food court with multiple family-owned restaurants and adequate spacing to get through the COVID-19 mess and whatever comes next. You might need to enlarge the building, and you might need to make changes to the structural framework to get the project done. Let’s include those expenditures in the definition of QIP so owners and lessees of such buildings can claim 100% first-year bonus depreciation for their expenditures.",
            "• Think converting square footage formerly occupied by a large departed business into hotel-style individual office suites and meeting rooms that can be reserved by employees who now work primarily from home. Adequate spacing would be a very good idea. You might need to enlarge the building, and you might need to make changes to the structural framework. Let’s include those expenditures in the definition of QIP so owners and lessees of such buildings can claim 100% first-year bonus depreciation for their expenditures.",
            "• Creating and expanding outdoor venues with adequate spacing will probably be a huge trend. Think outdoor restaurant dining areas, outdoor bars, outdoor music venues, outdoor wedding venues, and maybe the reemergence of drive-in movie theaters. And more. As the Tax Code currently reads, expenditures for these projects don’t count as QIP, so 100% first-year bonus depreciation cannot be claimed. Let’s fix that.",
            "Key Point: Many businesses will be lucky to break even this year. Many will lose money. Duh. For these businesses, being able to claim 100% first-year bonus depreciation for real estate QIP expenditures can potentially create or increase a net operating loss (NOL) that can then be carried back to earlier tax years. You can then claim refunds for taxes paid in those earlier years. Anything that creates or increases an NOL can be a business life-saver, because taxes paid in earlier can be recovered.",
            "The current rules for Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans stipulate that they can be forgiven only if at least 75% of the loan proceeds are used to cover qualified payroll expenses. That’s misguided. Continuing to pay employees doesn’t help a business that doesn’t need workers until its business model can be recalibrated to survive COVID-19 and whatever might come next. The PPP loan scheme should be renamed and retargeted to allow eligible businesses to spend loan proceeds on whatever is needed to survive.",
            "For instance, a family restaurant might need to reconfigure its interior space, add an outdoor bar and dining pavilion, and replace its entire food inventory. Until those things get done, you don’t need hosts, cooks, servers, and bussers.",
            "Finally, the IRS recently opined that expenses financed by a forgiven PPP loan cannot be deducted for federal income tax purposes. Congress apparently intended the opposite, but a law change may be necessary to fix that glitch. Let’s do it.",
            "In the COVID-19 era, individuals need financial relief too — including better-targeted tax relief. Here are two suggestions.",
            "Before the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), employers could give employees tax-free moving expense allowances or reimbursements (within limits). The TCJA suspended that valuable break for 2018-2025. Under the current rules, if your employer covers relocation expenses, it’s treated as additional wage income subject to federal income and payroll taxes. Ugh. We will surely see many employee relocations in response to COVID-19. Let’s once again allow employers to cover employee moving expenses with tax-free dollars.",
            "For 2018-2025, another TCJA provision suspended federal income tax deductions for an employee’s office in the home used for company business. Even before the TCJA, employee home office expenses were subject to limitations that ensured minimal or no tax-saving benefit in most cases. In light of current realities, let’s allow employees to claim home office deductions whether they itemize or not.",

An email from Credit Karma, a company consumers can use to access their credit score, notified her that a remark had been added to her credit report via Equifax EFX, +0.22%, the credit reporting agency.",
            "Curious and diligent about monitoring her credit score, Evans started investigating. She learned that her credit score had dropped six points and the reason was tied to her student loans. Evans, who says she remained current on her $45,000 in student debt through a repayment plan that allows borrowers to make payments based on how much income they earn, was shocked to see her credit score had changed. “I didn’t know what the heck I had done,” she said.",
            "“ ‘It’s another pressure, it’s another thing to worry about, it’s another battle to have to fight. It’s too much.’ ”",
            "To find out her credit score inexplicably dropped in the middle of a pandemic that’s already creating so much uncertainty, was unsettling, Evans said. The 28-year-old, who says she is currently sheltering in a temporary living arrangement, worries that any ding to her credit score could impact her search for affordable housing.",
            "“It’s another pressure, it’s another thing to worry about, it’s another battle to have to fight,” she said. “It’s too much.”",
            "Eventually, after sending messages on Twitter TWTR, +0.86% tagging the companies involved and eventually getting on the phone with her student-loan servicer, Great Lakes, Evans learned that her credit score decline was tied to the CARES Act, the $2.2-trillion stimulus bill that allowed student-loan borrowers to pause payments.",
            "She appears to be one of up to roughly five million borrowers whose score was dinged, despite instructions from Congress that the pause on student-loan payments shouldn’t affect borrowers’ credit scores.",
            "The situation highlights the challenges consumers are facing as they navigate pandemic-era relief programs. It also underscores the complex web of companies the hold sway over Americans’ personal finances, companies that control how consumers are judged through a process that’s poorly understood by the average person",
            "A credit score is a crucial metric that lenders use to assess borrowers’ eligibility for auto, home and other loans — and the price they pay for those loans — as well as renting apartments and other major purchases. In some cases, it’s even used by employers to evaluate a potential new hire. But it’s based on an algorithm that’s often opaque to consumers and it relies on lenders reporting information to credit bureaus accurately.",
            "“The faith in these credit reports being accurate is just enormous,” said Seth Frotman, the executive director of the nonprofit advocacy group Student Borrower Protection Center, which filed a class-action lawsuit against Great Lakes, Equifax, TransUnion TRU, -0.66%, Experian EXPGY, -0.71% and VantageScore accusing the companies of illegally damaging borrowers’ credit scores. “When the companies responsible fail, and in this case fail miserably, it could impact millions of borrowers’ lives.”",
            "One of the lead plaintiffs in the suit, Cody Hounanian, who is also the program director for Student Debt Crisis, another borrower advocacy group, saw his score drop by up to 33 points while searching for a home, the lawsuit alleges. Borrowers on social media have also complained of double digit drops in their scores.",
            "“ ‘The faith in these credit reports being accurate is just enormous. When the companies responsible fail, and in this case fail miserably, it could impact millions of borrowers’ lives.’ ”",
            "A consumer’s credit score is calculated based on information like whether payments are made on time and other factors that lenders report in a standardized way, typically monthly, to credit agencies like Experian, TransUnion and Equifax. Companies like FICO FICO, +1.09% and VantageScore suck that information into an algorithm to calculate a score that is supposed to predict how likely a consumer is to go delinquent in the relatively near future. A credit score is usually based on data from one of the credit bureaus.",
            "It’s a system that’s now used widely beyond its original intentions and that consumers have almost no way of opting out of if they want to use credit, said Dalié Jiménez, a professor at University of California, Irvine law school.",
            "“Your data is not your data in this sense,” she said. “They’re sharing it with a third party and then a lot of people have access to it, lots of things can happen as a result and you have no control over how that goes. Because it’s so basic and it’s been around for so long and everybody just accepts it, people don’t think about it.”",
            "The back and forth between the companies and agencies involved in this particular situation illustrates the challenges consumers face sorting through whether and how this important metric was affected.",
            "Thanks to borrower inquiries, Great Lakes, which together with its parent company Nelnet NNI, +1.22% services more than 40% of the government’s student-loan portfolio, discovered on May 11 that the company was reporting information about the forbearance period in the CARES Act in a way that could have negative consequences for borrowers, according to Ben Kiser, a spokesman for the company.",
            "The U.S. Department of Education had instructed servicers to report the paused payments to the credit agencies as if borrowers owed a $0 monthly payment, that they had paid it, and that they were current on their loans. Instead, Great Lakes reported those $0 monthly payments as deferred, Kiser said.",
            "In addition to working to adjust the reporting immediately, the company also encouraged borrowers to reach out to the credit reporting agencies directly, instead of using a third-party service, because Great Lakes believes that the error didn’t impact borrowers’ scores at those agencies, according to Kiser. Typically Equifax, Experian and TransUnion are only required to provide customers with free credit reports once a year, which is why consumers often rely on free credit reporting sites like Credit Karma. During the pandemic, consumers can access their credit reports directly from the credit bureaus weekly for free.",
            "The Department of Education offered guidance similar to Great Lakes’ on a website: “If you noticed a negative change in your credit information displayed by a third-party credit service, such as Credit Karma, you should verify your credit score with Equifax, Experian, or TransUnion.”",
            "But Emily Donohue, a spokeswoman for Credit Karma said the company simply publishes the credit information they receive from VantageScore, a credit score algorithm that was created by the three credit reporting agencies.",
            "“Credit Karma has no role in aggregating from the financial institutions the data VantageScore uses, nor does it own or contribute to the VantageScore 3.0 model,” Donohue wrote in an email. “Rather, Credit Karma is merely a conduit by which a member’s VantageScore is passed from the bureaus to our members (consumers).”",
            "VantageScore noted in a blog post earlier this month that some consumers saw their credit scores change as “as a result of the unprecedented widespread use of forbearance and deferment codes for consumer loans that have received payment relief by lenders.” The company also noted in the blog post that it was adjusting its model to minimize any damage from these deferment or forbearance codes.",
            "FICO, the other leading credit score provider, does not take deferments into account in its algorithm, so Great Lakes’ deferment coding didn’t affect borrowers’ FICO scores.",
            "To sum up: Great Lakes acknowledged its error, but believes that it didn’t affect borrowers’ scores held by the individual credit reporting agencies. At the same time, the third-party company where borrowers like Evans noticed their scores had dropped — Credit Karma — says it pulls customers’ scores directly from VantageScore, a credit score algorithm that uses data from the three credit reporting agencies and that is used by some lenders to assess creditworthiness.",
            "The issue is on its way to being resolved, Kiser said, because Great Lakes provided updated credit files to all four credit bureaus on May 15, and, as of Thursday three out of the four credit bureaus had already processed the files, and the fourth planned to do so shortly.",
            "Equifax, Experian and Transunion did not respond to requests for comment. The Consumer Data Industry Association, a group that represents all three agencies, “has worked closely with the three bureaus to support data furnishers’ consumer credit reporting activities during the pandemic in accordance with the CARES Act,” said president and CEO Francis Creighton. “The bureaus continue to work with servicers to ensure that student loan and other accommodations are being appropriately reflected on consumer credit reports and can be updated if necessary.”",
            "But the experience highlights the challenges involved in protecting borrowers in our current student-loan system and also raises questions about how consumers’ creditworthiness will be impacted by this period, said Persis Yu, the director of the Student Loan Borrower Assistance Project at the National Consumer Law Center.",
            "“One thing that has come out of this is that we don’t actually know what the impact of all of these different updates are on credit reporting,” Yu said. “The scoring models are a black box.”",
            "For Evans, these past few weeks have left her with the nagging feeling that she has little control over a marker that so many companies rely on to assess her financial health, despite staying on top of all of her loan payments. In addition to this most recent experience, Evans said she was a victim of the Equifax hack in 2017, and her score is still recovering from when one of her credit cards was closed unexpectedly by the lender for lack of use.",
            "“It feels like there’s no integrity in the process of credit scoring,” she said. “I don’t think it accurately represents any one’s decision making or priorities or responsibility.”"

            "For all that, Jan van Eck, CEO of a small family firm founded several decades ago to offer investors access to commodities in a mutual-fund package, says he’s “quite happy” with the way things stand right now.",
            "Van Eck likes the advantages of ETFs, he says, but “isn’t religious” about which types of funds may work best for investors. He’s deeply involved in product development within the company, but also focused on bigger issues, including serving on the board of directors of the National Committee on United States–China Relations. The company first had a presence in China since the 1990s.",

            "MarketWatch: VanEck, the company, got its start offering investors access to gold in a mutual fund, but now you’ve got only a handful of mutual funds and a few dozen ETFs. What is it about ETFs that’s good for end investors?",
            "Jan van Eck: We always think about the purpose of the fund in people’s portfolios. I actually sit with our active-portfolio managers, when we’re sitting in the office, and it takes up a bunch of my time. But I think the solution to active these days is you really have to have a concentrated, high-conviction portfolio that’s not just an “index plus.” I still believe in active, and I think for some areas, like probably sustainable investing, I think active actually has an advantage because you really need to get involved with the companies. I’m not religious one way or the other; it’s just that that’s really where our business has grown.",
            "MarketWatch: What’s your take on the new active nontransparent funds?",
            "Van Eck: Ah … you know, I don’t think that’s going to be a big thing. I think if you like an active strategy, as a U.S. investor, then for a taxable account, you’re happy to have that in an ETF because you get greater after-tax returns because of the tax advantages of the ETF wrapper. But I think the ETF ecosystem is in no way waiting for actively managed funds that they can’t see the underlying holdings of.",
            "See:What is a ‘nontransparent’ ETF, and why would anyone want to own one?",
            "MarketWatch: The other thing I’m really curious to get your take on is last week’s proposal by a bunch of industry heavyweights about sharpening up naming conventions. It was interpreted by a lot of folks as being heavy-handed, carving out as “normal” the more traditional approaches to investing that they are best known for and segregating off alternatives as “other.” What’s your take?",
            "Van Eck: I really like what I understand to be the objective of it, which is to correctly communicate to investors the essence of the fund and the risks and rewards. In fact, that’s kind of one of our internal philosophical principles, that, when you’re talking to investors, don’t just give them the upside, also communicate what the downside is.",
            "It’s really hard to know the future, and it’s really hard to know what’s going to blow up. The rules and the labeling doesn’t really get you there. Let me give you one example. People largely got access to commodities through commodities futures contracts like the United States Oil Fund USO, -3.87%. We knew that the shape of the futures curve is not something that any investor could see. But a lot of people brought these products to market saying, actually the curve gives you this advantage. When they first started, they basically said, you get an extra 4% annualized return basically because of the shape of the futures curve, and I’m like, yeah [laughing] until you don’t and it goes the other way.",
            "See:Are ETFs safe ... for retail investors?",
            "So it cost us a bit because we couldn’t figure out a good way to come up with a commodity fund — which is silly because we had this gold background. In the last year of the commodities bull market, we finally came up with a mutual fund [the Constant Maturity Commodity Fund CMCAX, -1.10% ] that does a constant rolling of the contracts. That made sense, but it’s better not to do something that has that much of an embedded risk.",
            "USO has blown up, but even in 2006 the difference between a commodities futures index and spot oil prices was 20%. So that potential risk was known. We also as a firm decided not to do leveraged products or inverse products for that very reason. There’s just no way you’re going to win the war of explaining to a client when you say, I’m giving you [three times] the return, and then you turn around and say, but we’re not going to give you that. That’s ridiculous.",
            "MarketWatch: What’s it like being a smaller firm going up against something like BlackRock or Vanguard?",
            "Van Eck: 80% of the time it’s no fun not being one of the ETF giants. I do talk about concentration of the ETF industry and a lot of other industries as well. But that’s partly the result of technology and scale and a lower cost to the customer, so I can’t fight it. Our goal is just to try to survive what I see as an ongoing consolidation effort.",
            "Having said that, I think now we’re in that 20% of the time where I’m actually happy to be a private firm. In this kind of turbulent environment we don’t have to worry about other kinds of nonsense — hiring freezes or whatever you might get in a larger organization. We can just keep on focusing on our growth plans. That’s a plus. Obviously having gold in our mix is a positive because our AUM — I’m sure it plummeted dramatically in March but has bounced back a little bit so that helps. We have enough resources and scale now to have a chance of surviving another decade.",

            "Van Eck: I guess how I would say it is, you don’t have to like China, but, if you’re an investor at all, then you have to have a view on China. The U.S. and China are the two engines for the global economy. What I do in my quarterly investment outlooks is try to make sure that we’re not having a U.S.-only conversation about the world economy because I think markets are affected by what’s going on in China. The last time commodity prices fell was in 2015, and it wasn’t because the U.S. was in a recession; it was because China was in a quasi-recession.",
            "See:No, China’s economy hasn’t gotten better, and the implications could be more serious than investors realize",
            "The biggest policy move last year was certainly when the Fed started cutting rates. I think they did that because they were afraid of a hard landing in China, which was slowing down their economy dramatically, raising interest rates in China, and also hurting their financial markets. I kind of describe the world as: We and China are in a life raft. We can bring out the knives, but I think both of us, no matter how much we’ve sharpened the knife and want to stab the other person, we’ll just end up puncturing the life raft, and then we’re going to be in the sea with the sharks. That’s where we sit economically.",
            "MarketWatch: With an election coming up, it seems like those knives are really coming out.",
            "Van Eck: My base case is that there’s no huge policy change that would affect the markets relative to China. There’s going to be a lot of rhetoric, I’m keenly aware of that. I’m on the board of a nongovernmental organization that works with China. They set up the first ping-pong match in 1972, and Henry Kissinger is on it, too. So I try to pay attention. But at the same time that there’s a lot of political rhetoric, there’s also a lot of opening up of China’s economy right now, as per the trade deal, so we’ll just have to see. I don’t mean to minimize it: There is a risk. But whether it really drives the markets, I’m not so sure.",
            "MarketWatch: You have an ETF ANGL, +0.36% that tracks “fallen angels,” which are bonds that were rated investment-grade at the time of issuance, but have since fallen into junk territory. Do you want to talk about the Fed getting into that corner of the market?",
            "Van Eck: This is a low-cost distressed-debt fund, right? It’s the year of fallen angels. We’ll have the biggest influx of fallen angels probably in our careers. I think the fund is well-positioned. It’s a great contrarian buying strategy.",
            "As far as the Fed’s policy, I’m against the Fed getting involved in the ETF markets. I don’t deny that they definitely helped liquidity of the markets, but I just think the ETF ecosystem is small, and it’s not necessary for them to use ETFs. In Europe, [central banks] did a lot of buying of instruments over the last decade, and they didn’t need to go to ETFs. I also think it’s an irreconcilable conflict for the biggest ETF firm to do the ETF buying. I don’t care how much sunlight there is on that process — it’s just sort of something you would not think would ever apply to another industry.",

            "With mortgage rates at record lows, refinancing should seem like a no-brainer if you can potentially save some money over the longer term. For people pursuing a FIRE retirement strategy, however, the decision to refinance depends on where you are in your pursuit of financial independence—and what you plan to do with any money you’d save from the refinancing.",
            "The “financial independence, retire early” strategy doesn’t change the factors individuals should consider before refinancing. A new loan at a lower rate means more than just a lower payment, says Mike Rauth, president of North Haven Financial, a FIRE-centric financial advisor in Scarborough, Maine. It also means hitting reset on your payback period. So consider whether you are willing to pay your mortgage for longer, which could potentially push off your retirement date.",
            "",
            "Rauth also cautions that pricey closing costs can mean homeowners may not break even for years. Homeowners should weigh their choices carefully. For example, refinancing may not make sense if your job situation is uncertain and you’re likely to have to move in the near future. Likewise, if you have, for example, 10 years left on your mortgage and you don’t break even on your closing costs for seven or eight years, just paying off your existing loan could be a better idea over the long term. “Do the math first, then consider your specific situation,” Rauth says.",
            "A lower mortgage payment can free up cash flow you can use to boost savings or accelerate investing. At the same time, writing a smaller check to the bank each month lowers the amount of monthly income you need to reach what Rauth calls a “work optional” state. “If you can drop your living expenses by $400 a month, that’s $400 a month less you need to take out of your investments when you ultimately are no longer getting a paycheck,” he says.",
            "If refinancing does make sense, how you put the extra funds to work is a personal decision. For families relatively early in their pursuit of financial independence, Rauth advises beefing up emergency funds. He also stresses the importance of appropriate life- and disability-insurance policies to provide for family members if you were to lose your job or become disabled.",
            "If those needs are already met, it might make sense to put the funds toward paying off your home more quickly by continuing to make loan payments at your current level. Just be mindful of whether your lender charges prepayment penalties.",
            "Another option: Putting extra funds to work in the stock market. While the market has been volatile in recent weeks, stocks are still down from their highs earlier in the year. It may make more sense for some investors to push excess money into their investment portfolio, especially as they rebalance their allocations of stocks and bonds.",
            "Though making extra payments on your mortgage offers a guaranteed return, low mortgage rates mean that guaranteed return will be relatively low as well. The long-term return on a stock-and-bond portfolio has generally been higher than what you’re likely to pay in mortgage interest at the moment, Rauth says.",
            "“The math on whether to pay down a mortgage or invest in the market generally favors the latter,” says Rauth.",

            "See: China to consider bill that would rein in Hong Kong’s autonomy",
            "During a virtual discussion hosted by the Heritage Foundation Friday morning, Martin Lee, founding chairman of the Hong Kong Democratic Party and popularly known as Hong Kong’s “Father of Democracy,” as well as Dennis Kwok, a member of Hong Kong’s Legislative Council and a democratic activist called it a “nightmare”.",
            "“What is happening in Hong Kong is truly heartbreaking,” Kwok said, after news that China’s parliament will consider a bill that would enable Chinese authorities to limit opposition party activity in Hong Kong, including protests or engaging in discussions with international allies, without the measure being considered by Hong Kong’s lawmaking body whatsoever. “The worst nightmare is happening before our eyes.”",
            "While the specific details of the legislation are not publicly known, Lee said that any move to bypass Hong Kong’s legislative council would be a breach of the ”joint declaration” made between the United Kingdom and China, when it handed over the former British colony in 1997 that ensured Hong Kong would operate under capitalist and democratic principles until at least 2047.",
            "“The world will now see that the joint declaration is being ignored,” Lee said. “Will Beijing be allowed to get away with it? If it can break an international agreement, registered at the United Nations and get away with it, they will be encouraged to break other agreements.”",
            "The move comes amid rapidly growing tensions between the U.S. and China over culpability for the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as over international trade, cross-border investment and other issues.",
            "U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo issued a statement Friday saying, “The United States strongly urges Beijing to reconsider its disastrous proposal, abide by its international obligations, and respect Hong Kong’s high degree of autonomy, democratic institutions and civil liberties, which are key to preserving its special status under U.S. law.”",
            "Hong Kong’s special trade status was granted by the U.S. in 1992 and enables the region to avoid certain tariffs, export restrictions and to enjoy free exchange between the Hong Kong dollar USDHKD, -0.01% and U.S. dollar DXY, -0.32%, all of which have helped enable it to remain a major center of international finance.",
            "Last year, Congress passed legislation that would require the Secretary of State to report annually to Congress on Hong Kong’s autonomy and whether the U.S. should maintain its unique bilateral relations. Revoking the special status could hit Hong Kong with the same large tariffs on exports to the U.S. that mainland China faces, while striking a blow to international confidence in the Hong Kong dollar, as well as the region’s rule of law.",
            "Even as China’s economy and financial markets have developed, Beijing still relies on Hong Kong as a source of foreign capital, with 54% of all foreign direct investment in China coming through Hong Kong in 2018, while mainland companies rely on operations there to take advantage of its rule of law, regulatory environment and professional services, according to Tianlei Huang of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.",
            "Kwok argued that revoking special status would be a “nuclear option” because “once you use it everyone will get hurt and it will be hard to build Hong Kong back up again.” But he still advised the U.S. to consider it because “a lot of people [in Hong Kong] are angry and actively call for the U.S. to cancel [the special status] to punish Beijing for acting the way they have acted.”",

            "WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump has a new pitch to voters for this fall: Trust me.",
            "As the economy faces a once-in-a-century recession, with more than 38 million people out of work, Trump is increasingly talking up a future recovery that probably won’t materialize until after the November election. He’s asking voters to look past the pain being felt across the nation and give him another four-year term on the promise of an economic comeback in 2021.",
            "“It’s a transition to greatness,” Trump says over and over, predicting a burgeoning economy come the fall. “You’re going to see some great numbers in the fourth quarter, and you’re going to end up doing a great year next year.”",
            "His chief economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, echoes the wait-until-next-year sentiment, holding out hope for a “big bang 2021.”",
            "It’s a delayed-reward tactic Trump was using long before the global pandemic gut-punched the country. He has turned to it with new urgency as the coronavirus has robbed him of the booming economy that was to be the core of his reelection message.",
            "Trump had already pledged to finally release a Republican health care plan after the polls closed — despite having served more than three years in office — along with a postelection tax cut and a “Phase 2” trade deal with China.",
            "Now, Trump is making the case to voters that if he helped bolster the economy once, he can do it again.",
            "“We built the greatest economy in the world,” Trump says frequently. “I’ll do it a second time.”",
            "It’s not just next year that will be a mystery to voters on Election Day. Trump and his team have been talking up the fourth quarter — October through December — but economic reports on that period won’t be released until 2021. Preliminary figures for the third quarter will be released Oct. 29, days before the Nov. 3 election. And unemployment could still be in double-digit territory by Election Day, White House economist Kevin Hassett and Eric Rosengren, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston said in television interviews Sunday.",
            "“Unfortunately, I think it’s likely to be double-digit unemployment through the end of this year,” Rosengren told CBS’ “Face the Nation.” To bring back the low jobless levels seen at the end of last February, he said it would probably take a vaccine or “other medical innovations that make it much less risky to go out.”",
            "Still, Trump and his campaign are hoping they can convince the public that Trump, not Democrat Joe Biden, is the candidate who can turn things around, even as they push the recovery timeline into next year.",
            "“The president has a clear record of building the economy to unprecedented heights before it was artificially interrupted by the coronavirus, and they know he will build it a second time,” said Trump campaign communications director Tim Murtaugh.",
            "Economists, however, warn that the “snap back” Trump’s advisers have been talking up is unlikely, given the severity of the recession. It will take years for the economy to recover, according to the Congressional Budget Office.",
            "Polling data suggests Trump has some work to do to persuade Americans that all will be well next year.",
            "Americans are split on whether they think the economy will improve (41%) or worsen (40%) over the coming year, according to a poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.",
            "Their opinions differ based on their politics. A majority of Republicans (62%) think the economy will get better in the coming year, while a majority of Democrats (56%) think it will get worse.",
            "The poll finds that only 49% of Americans now approve of how Trump is handling the economy, compared with 56% in March, though the numbers remain split largely on party lines.",
            "While a majority of Americans in households that lost a job do think it’s at least probable that the job will return, 70% now describe the state of the nation’s economy as poor, versus just 29% who say it’s good — down from 67% in January.",
            "Trump has been encouraging states to begin easing restrictions and reopening their economies. But that doesn’t necessarily mean jobs will return. While most of those who say they got a haircut at least monthly before the outbreak or shopped regularly in person for nonessential items would definitely or probably do so in the next few weeks if they were allowed, Americans may be wary to return to life as normal.",
            "Only about half of those who did so at least monthly before the outbreak say they’d travel, go to bars and restaurants, use public transportation, or exercise at a gym or studio. Just 42% of those who went to concerts, movies, or theater or sporting events at least monthly say they’d do so in the next few weeks if they could.",
            "Still, the poll shows that 66% of Americans continue to say that their personal financial situation is good — a number that has remained steady since before the outbreak began. Americans are also more likely to expect their personal finances to improve than worsen in the next year, 37% to 17%.",
            "In the end, that’s what is going to matter most, said Michael Steel, a Republican political strategist.",
            "“This election will turn on facts more than messages,” he said. “The president is placing a bet by reopening the economy before public health officials believe it is safe. If the economy recovers sharply and infection rates remain steady or go down, then voters will reward his boldness, but if we continue to see massive unemployment and a spike in new infections and deaths, all the political wordsmithery the world will offer won’t help him.”"

            "Will we have a “second wave” — or catch a “second wind”? asks Mark Haefele, chief investment officer of UBS Global Wealth Management, in a monthly outlook.",
            "A second wave wouldn’t just involve a recurrence of COVID-19 cases. It might also include a return of U.S.-China trade tensions — and U.S. equity valuations that are already relatively rich, even after the massive sell-off in March. Markets have been range-bound, waiting for more clarity on what Haefele thinks is the key question: whether virus infections will flare up again.",
            "Still, investors have to plan, and Haefele lays out three possible scenarios along with investment ideas for each.",
            "Upside Scenario: In this outlook, lockdown measures are eased throughout May and June, and do not need to be reimposed later. “In this case, we would expect some of the market segments that have underperformed, including cyclicals and value, to begin to outperform.”",
            "That outperformance won’t be across the board, Haefele stresses. In Europe, he suggests investors look to German and EMU industrials, and in the U.S., to mid-cap stocks, particularly those that benefit from a rebound in household consumption.",
            "While it’s natural to expect the value style to be in favor if the economic cycle gets a second wind, the best way to play that will likely be in U.S. energy stocks and U.K. equities, Haefele says. Since the U.S. dollar would likely depreciate in this scenario, the best currency bet versus the dollar DXY, -0.32% would likely be the British pound.",
            "Read:Here are the not-too-pricey stocks Goldman recommends as economies emerge from coronavirus shutdowns",
            "Central scenario: in Haefele’s base case, economic activity gets back to normal in May and June, but “economic functioning does not fully normalize until December.”",
            "Such a scenario would favor credit, particularly U.S. investment-grade LQD, and high-yield corporate debt HYG, +0.24% , USD emerging market sovereign bonds, and green bonds, Haefele said. It would also confirm some of the bank’s longer-term investment theses, such as telemedicine, genetic therapies, automation and robotics.",
            "Downside scenario: In the worst case, investors will be hard-pressed to find safe assets with attractive values, Haefele notes. While investors will likely reach for high-grade bonds TMUBMUSD10Y, 0.693% , they “already have such low yields that they are virtually guaranteeing the destruction of purchasing power over the long term,” he wrote. Gold GC00, -0.16% will likely rally.",
            "While the collapse in consumer demand over the course of the spring makes disinflation more likely than inflation over the short term, with the market pricing in record-low inflation, Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities could outperform if there’s any whiff of inflation or inflation uncertainty. That’s perhaps more possible than investors realize, Haefele noted, “given high levels of public debt and questions about central bank independence.”",
            "Investors may also instead choose to reach for active management, in whatever form it’s available: hedge funds or dynamic asset allocation funds.",

            "HONG KONG — Hong Kong police fired tear gas and a water cannon at protesters in a popular shopping district Sunday, as thousands took to the streets to march against China’s move to impose national security legislation on the city.",
            "Pro-democracy supporters have sharply criticized a proposal, set to be approved by China’s rubber-stamp parliament this week, that would ban secessionist and subversive activity, as well as foreign interference, in the semi-autonomous Chinese territory.",
            "The pro-democracy camp says the proposal goes against the “one country, two systems” framework that promises Hong Kong freedoms not found in mainland China.",
            "Crowds of demonstrators dressed in black gathered in the Causeway Bay district on Sunday, chanting slogans such as “Stand with Hong Kong,” “Liberate Hong Kong” and “Revolution of our times.”",
            "The protest was a continuation of a monthslong pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong that began last year and has at times descended into violence between police and protesters.",
            "Police raised blue flags, warning protesters to disperse, before firing multiple rounds of tear gas. They later fired a water cannon at the demonstrators.",
            "At least 180 people were arrested, mostly on charges of unlawful assembly, police said.",
            "They also said that some of the protesters threw bricks and splashed unidentified liquid at officers, injuring at least four members of the police media liaison team. They warned that such behavior is against the law and that police would pursue the matter.",
            "Earlier in the afternoon, prominent activist Tam Tak-chi was arrested during the protest for what police said was unauthorized assembly. Tam said he was giving a “health talk” and was exempt from social-distancing measures that prohibit gatherings of more than eight people.",
            "The bill that triggered Sunday’s rally was submitted at the opening of China’s national legislative session on Friday. It would bypass Hong Kong’s legislature and could allow mainland agencies to be set up in the city, sparking concern that Chinese agents could arbitrarily arrest people for activities deemed to be pro-democracy.",
            "Speaking at an annual news conference during the legislative session, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said Sunday that Hong Kong affairs were an internal matter for China, and that “no external interference will be tolerated.”",
            "“Excessive unlawful foreign meddling in Hong Kong affairs has placed China’s national security in serious jeopardy,” Wang said, adding that the proposed legislation “does not affect the high degree of autonomy in Hong Kong.”",
            "“It does not affect the rights and freedoms enjoyed by Hong Kong residents. And it does not affect the legitimate rights and interests of foreign investors in Hong Kong,” he said.",
            "U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has called the proposal “a death knell for the high degree of autonomy” that Beijing promised the former British colony when it was returned to China in 1997.",
            "Chris Patten, the last British governor of Hong Kong prior to its handover to China, lamented what he called “a new Chinese dictatorship.”",
            "“I think the Hong Kong people have been betrayed by China, which has proved once again that you can’t trust it further than you can throw it,” Patten said in an interview with The Times of London.",
            "Patten is leading a coalition of at least 204 international lawmakers and policymakers who are decrying the proposed legislation. In a statement, the coalition called it a “flagrant breach” of the Sino-British Joint Declaration, a 1984 treaty that promised Hong Kong a high degree of autonomy even after the handover of Hong Kong to China in 1997.",
            "President Donald Trump’s national security adviser, Robert O’Brien, said it appeared that China was violating the 1984 treaty.",
            "“And I can’t see how Hong Kong remains the Asian financial center if the Chinese Communist Party goes through and implements this national security law and takes over Hong Kong,” O’Brien said Sunday on CBS’s “Face the Nation.”",
            "“That would be a tragedy for the people of Hong Kong, but it will also be very bad for China,” he said.",
            "Bernard Chan, a top-level Hong Kong politician and delegate to the National People’s Congress in Beijing, defended the national security legislation pushed by China, saying it was written into Hong Kong’s Basic Law — the city’s mini-constitution — but never enacted.",
            "Chan expressed concern that Hong Kong would inevitably face economic hardship given trade frictions between the U.S. and China.",
            "“I think we are definitely the collateral damage being dragged into this thing. But then, I don’t think there’s any alternatives,” he said.",
            "“But with or without this law, honestly, the U.S. and China are always going to be continuing this loggerhead for quite some time to come,” Chan said. “China will remain as a threat to the U.S. in terms of the ... world economic dominance.”"

            "The alliance of Renault SA and Nissan Motor Co. is set to disclose billions of dollars in cost cuts this week and Nissan is looking to slash capacity by an additional million vehicles, according to people familiar with the plans.",
            "The moves will complete the undoing of the growth strategy pushed by Carlos Ghosn, former leader of both companies.",
            "The companies had planned to sell around 14 million cars by 2022, a target set by Mr. Ghosn, who envisioned a world-leading behemoth with a major presence in every market.",
            "Now, the target is closer to 10 million, according to the people familiar with the plans. Even before the coronavirus pandemic, the boom in demand the companies anticipated wasn't materializing, leaving plants underused.",
            "\"The situation has become untenable,\" said a person close to Renault.",
            "Mr. Ghosn has objected to efforts by Renault and Nissan to blame him for the current predicament. A spokeswoman for Mr. Ghosn said executives at Renault and Nissan had supported his growth plans. \"He cannot be held responsible for the state of companies that he has not been running for 18 months,\" she said.",
            "The entire car industry has been challenged by the coronavirus, but some are better-equipped to ride out the downturn in demand. Cash-rich Toyota Motor Corp., which unlike Nissan has avoided worker furloughs, said this month it expected a return to normal by the end of the year.",
            "In a series of announcements on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, Renault and Nissan are set to lay out their planned cuts and describe plans for closer cooperation. Renault owns 43.4% of Nissan.",
            "Nissan is planning to add around $3 billion in cost savings to $3 billion in cuts announced in July 2019 that have been largely carried out, said people familiar with the plans. Since the July 2019 announcement, Nissan has eliminated nearly 15,000 jobs, and further job reductions are planned along with budget cuts in every department from engineering to event planning, they said.",
            "The new plan also calls for cutting capacity by an additional million units beyond the cuts announced last year, bringing Nissan's annual production capacity to around 5.5 million vehicles, they said. That is still well above current demand in a pandemic-hit global market.",
            "\"Under Carlos Ghosn, the company was talking about selling seven, eight, nine million cars. So, all the budgeting at the company was sized around hitting those numbers,\" said a person close to Nissan.",
            "In the U.S., where 10,000 workers have been furloughed during the coronavirus shutdowns, no large-scale permanent production cuts are set to be disclosed, but Nissan plans to shut a production line at its plant in Canton, Miss., said a person close to the company.",
            "For its part, Renault has said it aims to cut structural costs by at least EUR2 billion ($2.2 billion), or 20%, over the next three years.",
            "The French auto maker is looking at factory closures, which is particularly sensitive now because the company is completing a EUR5 billion state-backed loan to ride out the pandemic. France's economy ministry is asking Renault to keep technologically advanced activities in France and develop electric batteries in Europe.",
            "Small sites in Brittany and Choisy-le-Roi near Paris are likely to be closed, while a factory in the northern French town of Dieppe that produces Renault's luxury Alpine brand could also be closed, according to the people familiar with Renault's plans. The next generation of the Alpine will likely be electric and be built somewhere else, one of the people said.",
            "Meanwhile, Renault's flagship factory of Flins near Paris could stop producing vehicles within the next few years, the people said. The site produces the electric Zoe, but that production will likely be moved to another Renault factory when the next generation of the vehicle arrives. A planned expansion in Morocco is likely to be reversed.",
            "\"Renault is in serious financial difficulty,\" said France's economy minister, Bruno Le Maire, on Friday. \"There is an urgent need for action at Renault.\"",
            "Renault has already announced plans to close its main China business. That country remains one of Nissan's core markets, alongside the U.S. and Japan, and a potential bright spot as the coronavirus recovery proceeds. Nissan's China sales in April matched their year-earlier level.",
            "Some steps the companies are weighing won't be ready for the announcements this week. Nissan is still reviewing a plant in southern India that has fallen far short of expectations.",
            "Separately, it is looking to trim costs at its struggling Infiniti luxury brand by having Infiniti and Nissan use more common parts and platforms, similar to the way Toyota operates its Lexus brand, said people familiar with the plans.",
            "Even in markets where downsizing is planned, Renault, Nissan and Mitsubishi hope they can keep a foothold by making more use of each other's factories, research outfits and back-office personnel.",
            "Nissan is closing its factory in Indonesia but will still produce vehicles at Mitsubishi plants in the region -- a market where the smaller Japanese company has a stronger presence. Renault will produce vehicles for Nissan in Europe and South America.",
            "Still, sharing factories and research relies on the alliance working smoothly, something Renault and Nissan have struggled to do in the wake of Mr. Ghosn's sudden departure after his arrest in Tokyo in November 2018. The executive fled to Lebanon in December to escape financial-misconduct charges in Japan, which he denies.",
            "People on both sides said that although Renault and Nissan would announce plans for closer cooperation this week, negotiations on specifics would continue after that.",

Secretary (of State Mike) Pompeo will likely be unable to certify that Hong Kong maintains a high degree of autonomy and if that happens there will be sanctions that will be imposed on Hong Kong and China,” he said.",
            "O’Brien also said a move by China to take further control over Hong Kong could send its financial community fleeing.",
            "“I just don’t see how [the financial industry] can stay,” he said. “One reason that they came to Hong Kong is because there was the rule of law there, there was a free-enterprise system, there was a capitalist system, there was democracy and local legislative elections. If all those things go away, I’m not sure how the financial community can stay there.”",
            "Thanks to its special status, light regulations and location, Hong Kong is the world’s third-largest financial center, behind London and New York.",

            "The bill surfaced last week at China’s ceremonial National People’s Congress, which would allow China to override Hong Kong’s local government, allowing it to quell demonstrations and rein in free speech. The bill is scheduled to be voted on by May 28.",

            "LONDON — Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Sunday he wouldn’t fire his chief aide for allegedly violating the national lockdown rules that he helped to create by driving the length of England to his parents’ house while he was infected with the coronavirus.",
            "Defying a growing clamor from public and politicians, Johnson said Dominic Cummings had acted “responsibly, legally and with integrity” when he drove 250 miles from London to Durham, in northeast England, with his wife and son at the end of March.",
            "Britain’s lockdown, which began March 23, stipulated that people should remain at their primary residence, leaving only for essential local errands and exercise. Anyone with coronavirus symptoms was told to completely isolate themselves.",
            "Cummings says he traveled to be near extended family because his wife was showing COVID-19 symptoms, he correctly thought he was also infected and he wanted to ensure that his 4-year-old son was looked after.",
            "Johnson told a news conference that Cummings had “followed the instincts of every father and every parent.” He said Cummings, his wife and son followed the rules by self-isolating for 14 days once they reached Durham.",
            "But critics of the government expressed outrage that Cummings had broken strict rules that for two months have prevented Britons from visiting elderly relatives, comforting dying friends or even attending the funerals of loved ones. The opposition Labour Party has called for an official investigation.",
            "Labour leader Keir Starmer said Johnson’s defense of Cummings was “an insult to sacrifices made by the British people.”",
            "“The prime minister’s actions have undermined confidence in his own public health message at this crucial time,” he said .",
            "Former Labour lawmaker Helen Goodman, whose father died in a nursing home during the outbreak, said Cummings’ behavior was “repellent.”",
            "“What was the point of the sacrifice that we all made? What was the point of the miserable, lonely death that my father had?” she told the BBC.",
            "Speaking inside the prime minister’s 10 Downing St. residence, Johnson said “I can totally get why people might feel so confused and ... so offended by the idea that it was one thing for the people here and one thing for others.”",
            "But he said Cumming’s “particular childcare needs” left him “no alternative” but to make the 250-mile trip.",
            "Government ministers have denied a claim that Cummings was spotted again in Durham on April 19, after he had recovered and returned to work in London. But they have not confirmed or denied report that Cummings visited a scenic area 30 miles (50 kilometers) from Durham on April 12.",
            "Cummings is a key but contentious figure in Johnson’s administration. A self-styled political disrupter who disdains the media and civil service, he was one of the architects of the successful campaign to take Britain out of the European Union, and orchestrated the Conservatives’ decisive election victory in December.",
            "The coronavirus cut a swath through the top ranks of Britain’s government in March and April, infecting people including Cummings, Health Secretary Matt Hancock and Johnson himself, who has said that the medical staff at a London hospital saved his life.",
            "Despite the government’s support for Cummings, several lawmakers from Johnson’s Conservative Party joined the opposition in calling for the aide to be sacked.",
            "“Dominic Cummings has a track record of believing that the rules don’t apply to him and treating the scrutiny that should come to anyone in a position of authority with contempt,” tweeted Conservative lawmaker Damian Collins. “The government would be better without him.”",
            "Another Tory legislator, Steve Baker, said Cummings must resign for not “abiding by the spirit, at least, of the slogans which he has enforced on the rest of the country.”",
            "Johnson’s government is already facing criticism for its response to a pandemic that has hit Britain harder than any other European country. Britain’s official coronavirus death toll stands at 36,793, the second-highest confirmed total in the world after the United States. Statistics that include suspected as well as confirmed virus cases put the toll well over 40,000.",
            "The U.K. is gradually easing its lockdown, allowing more outdoor recreation and letting some shops and businesses reopen.",
            "Johnson confirmed Sunday that primary schools can start reopening in June, though many parents and teachers worry that it isn’t yet safe to do so.",
            "Johnson said the government was still aiming to have pupils in the first and final years of primary school back in classrooms on June 1, though he acknowledged that “may not be possible for all schools.”",
            "Cummings is one of several senior U.K. officials to be accused of flouting the lockdown rules.",
            "Epidemiologist Neil Ferguson stepped down as government scientific adviser earlier this month after a newspaper disclosed that his girlfriend had crossed London to stay with him during the lockdown. In April, Catherine Calderwood resigned as Scotland’s chief medical officer after twice traveling from Edinburgh to her second home."

            "The 125-page ruling was issued by U.S. District Court Judge Robert Hinkle in Tallahassee. It involves a state law to implement a 2016 ballot measure approved by voters to automatically restore the right to vote for many felons who have completed their sentence. The Republican-led Legislature stipulated that fines and legal fees must be paid as part of the sentence, in addition to serving any prison time.",
            "Hinkle has acknowledged he is unlikely to have the last word in the case, expecting the administration of Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis to launch an appeal.",
            "The case could have deep ramifications in the crucial electoral battleground given that Florida has an estimated 774,000 disenfranchised felons who are barred because of financial obligations. Many of those felons are African Americans and presumably Democrats, though it’s unclear how that group of Floridians overall would lean politically in an election and how many would vote.",
            "The judge called the Florida rules a “pay to vote” system that are unconstitutional when applied to felons “who are otherwise eligible to vote but are genuinely unable to pay the required amount.”",
            "A further complication is determining the exact amount in fines and other kinds of legal fees owed by felons seeking the vote — by some estimates it would take elections officials several years for those pending now. Hinkle said it’s unconstitutional to bar any voter whose amount owed could not be “determined with diligence.”",
            "Hinkle ordered the state to require election officials to allow felons to request an advisory opinion on how much they owe — essentially placing the burden on elections officials to seek that information from court systems. If there’s no response within three weeks, then the applicant should not be barred from registering to vote, the ruling said.",
            "Hinkle said the requirement to pay fines and restitution as ordered in a sentence is constitutional for those “who are able to pay” — if the amount can be determined.",

The president has preferred to offload key responsibilities and decisions to states and governors, despite calls for a coordinated national response.",
            "“All of this is probably not as well thought out as it could have been.” said Dr. Jim Wright, the medical director at a Virginia nursing home where dozens of residents have died. “It sounds more like an impulsive type of directive rather than one that has been completely vetted by providers on the ground.”",
            "On May 11, Trump heralded his administration’s efforts to boost coronavirus testing and said the U.S. had developed the “most advanced robust testing system in the world, by far.” That same day, Vice President Mike Pence hosted a private conference call with the state’s governors, where White House adviser Dr. Deborah Birx requested that each state target nursing homes to help lower the virus’ death toll.",

            "“I think it’s very important to do and I think, frankly, some of the governors were very lax with respect to nursing homes,” Trump said.",
            "Birx acknowledged Friday that the two-week recommendation was a challenge but said it was needed because of the particular vulnerability of nursing homes.",
            "“We should never be discouraged by those who can’t get it done,” she said. “We should be encouraged by those who have shown us that it can be done.”",
            "Nursing homes residents, who are typically older and often have underlying medical conditions, have been particularly hard hit by the virus. More than 36,000 residents and staff have died from outbreaks at the nation’s nursing homes and long-term care facilities, according to an AP tally. . That is more than a third of all deaths in the U.S. that have been attributed to the virus.",
            "Nursing home operators have said the lack of testing kits and other resources have left them nearly powerless to stop the virus from entering their facilities because they haven’t been able to identity silent spreaders not showing symptoms.",
            "The American Health Care Association, the main nursing home trade group, said more than half of its members said they were unable to test all residents and staff within two weeks because of a lack of access to testing. The group also estimates that testing every nursing home resident and staff member would involving testing nearly 3 million people at a cost of $440 million.",
            "Even with the tests, nursing homes struggle to find people to administer them and carve out enough time to perform them.",

John Carney announced a plan May 5 for universal testing of all residents and staff in nursing homes and other long-term care facilities, but the testing program is voluntary. On Friday, the state said three-quarters of long-term care facilities had requested testing kits, and that weekly testing of staff would be mandatory starting in June.",

            "WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump booked back-to-back Memorial Day appearances despite the coronavirus pandemic, at Arlington National Cemetery and at a historic fort in Baltimore.

            "Presidents typically honor fallen military members by laying a wreath and delivering a speech at the hallowed burial ground in Virginia. But the pandemic, which is expected to claim its 100,000th American this week, has led to changes this year. Trump will only lay a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.",
            "He is expected to speak later at Baltimore’s Fort McHenry National Monument and Historic Shrine. It’s where a poem, written after a huge American flag was hoisted to celebrate an important victory over the British during the War of 1812, became the “ The Star-Spangled Banner.”",
            "Trump has been steadily ramping up his schedule in an effort to portray the nation as returning to its pre-pandemic ways as it emerges from a devastating economic shutdown intended to slow the virus.",

            "So far this month, Trump has toured factories in Arizona, Pennsylvania and Michigan that make pandemic supplies. He planned to be in Florida on Wednesday to watch two NASA astronauts rocket into space, and he played golf at his private club in Virginia on Saturday and Sunday.",
            "Baltimore Mayor Bernard C. “Jack” Young has criticized Trump’s visit, saying the trip sends the wrong message about stay-at-home directives and that the city cannot afford the added cost of a presidential visit at a time when it is losing $20 million a month because of the pandemic.",
            "“That President Trump is deciding to pursue nonessential travel sends the wrong message to our residents,” Young, a Democrat, said in a statement last week. He referenced the disproportionate effect the virus has had on his city and called on Trump to “set a positive example” by not traveling during the holiday weekend.",

            "“The brave men and women who have preserved our freedoms for generations did not stay home and the president will not either as he honors their sacrifice by visiting such a historic landmark in our nation’s history,” White House spokesman Judd Deere said in an emailed statement Sunday.",

Baltimore and the Washington, D.C., area have the nation’s highest percentages of positive cases, according to Dr. Deborah Birx, coordinator of the White House coronavirus task force.",

            "He visited Baltimore months later to address a meeting of congressional Republicans, and a giant inflatable rat adorned with Trump-style hair and a red necktie taunted from a few blocks away. Trump did not visit any Baltimore neighborhoods.",

            "NBA spokesman Mike Bass said the conversations were still “exploratory,” and that the Disney site would be used for practices and housing as well.",
            "“Our priority continues to be the health and safety of all involved, and we are working with public health experts and government officials on a comprehensive set of guidelines to ensure that appropriate medical protocols and protections are in place,” Bass said.",

            "The ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex is a 255-acre campus with multiple arenas that could host games simultaneously and has been home to, among other things, the Jr. NBA World Championship in recent years. ESPN, one of the NBA’s broadcast partners, is primarily owned by Disney.",
            "Space won’t be an issue, even if Major League Soccer — which is also in talks to resume its season at Disney — is there at the same time as the NBA. The entire Disney complex is roughly 40 square miles, with nearly 24,000 hotel rooms owned or operated by Disney within the campus.",
            "The NBA suspended its season March 11, becoming the first of the U.S. major pro leagues to do so after it was revealed that All-Star center Rudy Gobert of the Utah Jazz tested positive for COVID-19. The list of NBA players who were known to test positive eventually grew to 10 — not all were identified — and Commissioner Adam Silver said last month that the actual total was even higher.",
            "But the league has been working on countless return-to-play scenarios for several weeks, all with the caveat that testing would be an integral part of any resumption of the season.",
            "It remains unknown where the NBA is in the process of securing tests or developing large-scale testing protocols. Also unclear: how many regular-season games would be played before the postseason begins — or if all 30 teams would be playing. The league has asked team general managers for additional input on those matters.",
            "Jared Dudley of the Los Angeles Lakers said in a conference call with reporters on Wednesday that he believes the playoffs, whenever they start, will be the traditional best-of-seven format.",
            "“That’s the money-winner when it comes to Disney,” Dudley said. “That’s why we’ll be in Orlando. Disney owns ESPN. That’s where they make their money. During the playoffs and finals, it will all be seven games. That one I’m almost 100% sure of.”",
            "Central Florida has been known as a viable option to host an NBA restart since at least mid-April, and other cities — such as Las Vegas, which also has a longstanding relationship with the NBA — were known to be considered as well.",
            "Florida has confirmed just over 50,000 COVID-19 cases, though more than half of those are in Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach counties and not in the Orlando area. Gov. Ron DeSantis has said he wants the state open for pro sports, even telling franchises not based in Florida that they could come to the Sunshine State and train if restrictions preventing it existed in their own locales.",
            "“Places are opening up. Let’s not forget COVID isn’t magically less contagious now,” Malcolm Miller of the Toronto Raptors tweeted Saturday. “The virus itself didn’t get better... stay safe.”",
            "Teams have been allowed to welcome players back to their training facilities for voluntary sessions since May 8, and more than half of the league’s franchises have taken advantage of that opportunity.",
            "The next steps along a return-to-play path would likely include a loosening of the restrictions for those voluntary workouts — no more than four players are currently allowed inside any facility at a time — and then a plan for when training camps could open. If the league plans to resume play in late July, then camps conceivably could open around the start of that month.",
            "Rescheduling at least some regular season games could be a major perk for players, even though some teams are out of the playoff mix.",
            "The league can take about 1.08% percent of a player’s salary for each regular season game that is not played if what the collective bargaining agreement between the league and its players describes as a “Force Majeure Event,” the legal term for unforeseeable circumstances such as an epidemic or pandemic, is enacted.",
            "The more regular season games played, the less money the players will lose."

            "The German economy posted its largest decline in output since the financial crisis in the first quarter and entered a recession due to the coronavirus pandemic and the lockdown implemented in mid-March, the German statistics office Destatis said Monday, confirming a preliminary estimate.",
            "As previously reported, gross domestic product--the broadest measure of goods and services produced in an economy--contracted 2.2% in the first quarter compared with the previous quarter. GDP fell 2.3% on year in the first quarter on a calendar and price-adjusted basis, Destatis said, confirming the first estimate.",
            "This is the second largest decrease since German unification, following a 4.7% decline in the first quarter of 2009, Destatis said.",
            "Household final consumption decreased an adjusted 3.2% and fixed capital formation in machinery and equipment declined 6.9%. Government expenditure rose 0.2% and fixed capital formation in construction increased 4.1%, preventing an even larger GDP decrease.",
            "Foreign trade also declined due to the coronavirus. According to provisional calculations, exports were down 3.1%, after price, seasonal and calendar adjustment. While exports of goods decreased 4.0%, exports of services increased 0.7%. Imports of goods and services were down 1.6%.",
            "The lockdown started in Germany on March 22 and was less stringent than in other eurozone countries. Economists expect to see a sharper GDP contraction in the second quarter. With the German economy starting its gradual reopening on April 20, a larger chunk of second-quarter output will be lost than in the first quarter.",
            "Roughly 45 million people were in employment in the first quarter, an increase of 147,000 people or 0.3% on year. Such a small year-on-year increase had last been observed in the second quarter of 2010, Destatis said.",
            "One of the reasons why the pandemic had only a moderate impact on the number of persons in employment in the first quarter is that short-time workers are counted as persons in employment, Destatis said.",
            "Northern European countries, by and large, shrank far less than its Mediterranean counterparts. The Dutch economy contracted 1.7% in the first quarter, while the Italian economy declined 4.7% during the first quarter, France posted a historic contraction of 5.8% and the Spanish economy plunged a record 5.2%, according to preliminary estimates.",

            "The time has long passed for Washington to force Chinese companies to provide the same investor protections that U.S. companies have for decades, says Democratic Rep. Brad Sherman of California, who is leading the effort in the House of Representatives to force Chinese companies to submit to U.S. securities laws, or be barred from raising money in U.S. financial markets.",
            "“The purpose here is not to delist or de-register; it’s to demand that China do what every other country has done and agree that if their companies want to participate in U.S. capital markets, they agree to live by U.S. capital-markets rules,” Sherman argued in an interview with MarketWatch. “It’s time for China to blink first for the benefit of investors.”",
            "See also:An emerging-market debt crisis could be the next front in U.S.-China conflict",
            "Sherman introduced a House version of the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act Wednesday night, after the bill passed the Republican-controlled Senate earlier in the day with unanimous support.",
            "The bill would require that foreign companies let the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board oversee the auditing of their financial records if they want to raise money by selling stocks or bonds to the American public. All U.S. companies and most foreign entities already work with the PCAOB in this way, but Chinese companies do not.",
            "The PCAOB was created by the 2002 Sarbanes-Oxley Act, in response to the collapse of companies like Enron and WorldCom, after the auditors of those companies failed to uncover financial deception. The PCAOB’s role is to audit the auditors and provide another layer of protection for U.S. investors.",
            "That bill was never intended to exempt foreign countries, Sherman said, but the financial-services industry lobbied to list companies from China, the world’s fastest-growing large economy. As investor demand for Chinese securities grew, the Securities and Exchange Commission came to a compromise with Chinese regulators in 2013 that paved the way for widespread listing of Chinese companies, including stock offerings by technology giants like Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. BABA, -5.87%, Baidu Inc. BIDU, -6.09% and JD.com Inc. JD, -5.07%.",
            "Don’t miss: Congress could kick China listings off U.S. stock exchanges, but it won’t happen overnight, giving Chinese companies breathing space to weigh response",
            "The 2013 agreement was supposed to lead to the PCAOB’s getting greater access to Chinese auditing documents, but “China backslid on their commitments,” Sherman said. “Basically China got tough and we got weak.”",
            "Sherman introduced a similar bill last year, but as anti-China sentiment has grown in Washington, he said that there is now bipartisan support for measures like this one that were once only supported by factions skeptical of the U.S. financial industry. With growing anti-China sentiment, he thinks his bill will pass before the end of the summer.",
            "See:U.S.-China relations are bad and getting worse, with major ramifications for trade and investment — and the U.S.’s presidential election",
            "His hope is to improve the bill through deliberation in the House, to create exemptions for some firms, like those that are majority owned and operated in the U.S. but have small Chinese subsidiaries whose financial records can’t be verified by U.S. regulators.",
            "“Some support for the bill is just about making a statement vis-à-vis China, and some people may not care to wait while I work on some of the technical language,” he said. “So there’s a slight possibility that it passes without improvement, there’s some possibility that it doesn’t pass it all, and the most likely outcome is that it passes in the next three months with some improvements.”",
            "Sherman stressed, however, that his hope is not to force Chinese companies out of U.S. financial markets, but to improve U.S. investor protection.",
            "“The goal here is to demand that China do what every other country has done,” he said. “That is to make sure that if they’re tapping into U.S. capital markets, they do it under U.S. capital-market rules.”"

            "One summer a few years ago, at her grandfather’s 90th birthday party, Francesca Cartier Brickell discovered something extraordinary. Brickell was searching for Champagne in the cellar of her grandfather’s home in southern France when she spied a lone leather trunk embossed with her grandfather’s initials, JJC, for Jean-Jacques Cartier. Curiosity struck. She opened it. Inside, Brickell found a trove of letters. They were the personal correspondences of the Cartier clan dating back 150 years, across continents.",
            "Brickell, 42, had often asked about her grandfather’s time in the family’s illustrious jewelry business (King Edward VII called Cartier “the jeweler of kings”). A modest man, he had never offered up much more than self-deprecating anecdotes. This chance discovery launched Brickell, who earned a degree in English at Oxford years earlier, on a globe-spanning journey seeking  the details of her family’s incredible past, from Russia to America. ",
            "The result is The Cartiers: The Untold Story Of The Family Behind The Jewelry Empire, a goliath of a book spanning four generations, from the French Revolution to the 1970s, when the company was sold (today it is owned by Richemont). The work, which came out last November, is as much a world history book as it is a tale of her family, Brickell says. Indeed, this aspect of it is what initially attracted her to the project. “What interested me was following this world history, with always the same characters, my ancestors,” she says from her late grandfather’s house in the south of France.",
            "Prior to publication, Brickell, who is based in London, worked as a financial analyst at Barclays Capital. This is her first book. ",
            "Penta reached out to hear more about how the book came together, what Brickell learned about the evolution of elite style and how she came to feel a greater connection to her most unique family.",
            "PENTA : Were you looking for a book idea at the time of your discovery in the cellar?",
            "Francesca Cartier Brickell: When I had my first child, just before then, I was deciding whether to go back to the corporate world after maternity leave. I didn’t really want to go back to such a full time job. And I had always had the idea, before grandpa died, to record this history for my children, to write it down at some point. But not necessarily in a book. But finding this trunk of letters was like an enormous sprawling world history. It fascinated me, and I hoped it might be interesting to others as well.",
            "What was your grandfather like?",
            "He was the most wonderful guy. So generous—the reason he wanted me to get that Champagne was because he’d always rather give than receive presents on his birthday. That year he was 90 and his health was quite bad. He couldn’t drink himself. He wanted us to all enjoy it. He was so modest. You’d never know that he had run Cartier. He was an artist at heart—quiet, understated, introverted. His house was always beautiful. I had to ask him about the past: he was never one to boast. He’d tell funny stories that put him in an awkward light. He told me once that when he was going to meet the royal family at Buckingham Palace, he’d fallen asleep whilst waiting and had to be woken by the Queen Mother. He was totally mortified. ",
            "What was your childhood like? ",
            "Basically grandpa sold the business a few years before I was born, then moved to France. I grew up in England. The name was in my passport, but I didn’t really feel connected to the firm. To me, he was just grandpa. It was only when I started speaking to him and reading those letters that I found a jolt of connection to my ancestors. Before that, they were just black-and-white people in photographs.",
            "What attracted you to this subject as a narrative story? ",
            "One, that it’s a story about people. These letters suddenly showed them for who they were. The Cartier brothers had an incredible bond, but they also had anxieties and arguments sometimes. There were rivalries, betrayals. They became fully rounded people. And also, it basically became the story of world history, the shifting powers. You follow the jewels and the money. Paris, in the early 20th century, was the capital of the cultural world. And you had the Romanovs in Russia—he Cartiers were there. But then after the First World War, when Europe was devastated, and after the Russian Revolution, the power base switched to America. The family was in India with the Maharajas. Then with Indian Independence, it goes to the Middle East. ",
            "They were writing letters the whole time, describing what they saw, what they found, the people they met. Those early times to me were really fascinating, like when they went to Russia and set up a pop-up store in St. Petersburg at Christmas time to sell jewels to the Romanovs, who were the richest people in the world. After the revolution, because they’d made those connections with the Romanovs, they were able to buy those jewels back from them and sold them on to the Americans. Then after the Great Depression, they were able to buy them back from the Americans and sell them all again to the Indians. ",
            "What did you learn about how style changes over time?",
            "The Cartiers were always innovating. Their motto was, “Never copy, only create.” They would take inspiration from everywhere except existing jewelry. Louis Cartier, one of three sons of the founder Louis-Francois Cartier, was the one who came up with the idea for the wristwatch for airmen. He was friends with an early pilot, Alberto Santos-Dumont, who was complaining to Louis that he couldn’t check his pocket watch whilst he was flying, because he had his hands on the controls. It was very hard to break into the male wristwatch market because wristwatches were normally in diamonds or silk, like women’s bracelets. Louis gave his first watch to Santos-Dumont and, because he was such a global celebrity at the time, it imbued the wristwatch with a sense of style. Men were curious what this celebrity was wearing; he was an early brand ambassador. ",
            "As fashions changed, they had to change the jewels. After the Second World War, when women suddenly cut their hair short, they couldn’t wear a big tiara atop their head anymore; they had to change. So they made a bandeau instead because it sits lower on the head. They gave them longer earrings because suddenly they could see the earrings. They didn’t have big heavy corsets anymore either, so they had long necklaces to go with the dresses. In the Depression years, with no money for big jewels, they came up with inventions: pens with compasses on them, lighters—more practical objects. They were continually adapting. ",

The decision affects some 60,000 individual claims brought by car owners there; around 262,000 others have already been covered by an 830 million euro ($904 million) class-action settlement.",
            "“For the majority of the 60,000 pending cases, this ruling provides clarity,” the company said in a statement. “Volkswagen is now seeking to bring these proceedings to a prompt conclusion in agreement with the plaintiffs. We will therefore approach the plaintiffs with the adequate settlement proposals. The aim is to relieve the burden on the judiciary as quickly as possible.”",
            "The case that was decided Monday involved a plaintiff who bought a Volkswagen Sharan model in 2014 that was equipped with the software that turned off emissions controls during testing. He had sought the full purchase price but the court ruled he must accept less due to depreciation related to the distance he drove. The individual case is expected to serve as a guideline for others.",
            "Volkswagen was caught cheating by U.S. authorities in September 2015 and has since paid more than 33 billion euros in fines and settlements worldwide. Two executives went to prison in the United States and more are facing criminal proceedings and investigations in Germany.",

            "In Germany, state governments are responsible for imposing and lifting lockdown restrictions. All 16 states currently have coronavirus rules, including physical distancing requirements and an obligation to wear masks on public transport and shops, and Thuringia’s new approach would raise pressure on other states to ease their lockdowns further.",

            "As it stands, Germany’s public health agency, the Robert Koch Institute, said Monday that several states reported no new cases overnight, and that the overall total grew by only 289. The seven-day reproduction factor, defined as the mean number of people infected by an infected person, remained under 1 at 0.93, indicating a contraction of new cases.",

It relied on the Forbes’ billionaire list, which itself is built around stock-market performance.",

You then get to see who got richer even in the face of the crippling economic blow.",
            "The real answer is, not many have. MarketWatch ran the numbers from the peak and, in the interest of time, only used the top 50 billionaires. MarketWatch also took the cheat of using the S&P 500 SPX, +0.23% for billionaires with private interests rather than Forbes’ more complex method. (Also, MarketWatch didn’t look at stock purchases during the month.)",

            "Indeed, caustic rhetoric between the No. 1 and 2 economies in the world is intensifying — again.",
            "It may feel as if the animus between the global superpowers couldn’t come at a more inopportune time: in the middle of a pandemic, which notably was first identified in Wuhan, China in December, and has infected more than 5 million people around the world, according to data aggregated by Johns Hopkins University.",
            "As MarketWatch’s sister publication Barron’s writes, the Sino-American issues are many and include actions taken by the U.S. to censure China’s new security rules that threaten Hong Kong’s semiautonomous status, restrictions against Huawei Technologies, a push to increase scrutiny of Chinese companies listed in the U.S., funding for the World Health Organization, and accountability for the handling of the viral outbreak that has likely ushered in one of the most severe global recessions in the past 100 years.",
            "“The list is long as my arm,” said Ian Bremmer, Eurasia Group’s founder and president, of the Sino-American tensions, during a Friday interview on CNBC.",
            "“It’s never a good thing that the two largest economies in the world are battling,” Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer of Bleakley Advisory Group, told MarketWatch in an emailed exchange on Friday.",
            "Tensions between the countries, however, don’t seem to have supplanted the intense investor focus on reopening the economy in the U.S., and elsewhere in the world, or attention on a cure for the COVID-19 pandemic, which have helped to buoy risk assets.",
            "“I think the market likely sees the upside risk related to finding a vaccine or treatment as near-term, and the downside risk related to China as long-term, so they are focusing more on the near-term right now,” Lindsey Bell, chief investment strategist with Ally Invest, told MarketWatch on Friday.",
            "On Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, DJIA, -0.03% the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.23%, the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +0.42% logged lackluster moves, even as the indexes all notched weekly gains of more than 3%.",
            "The small-capitalization Russell 2000 index RUT, surged 7.6% for the week, suggesting that investors were scooping up smaller-cap companies, more sensitive to economic vagaries, just in case efforts to restart businesses proved successful.",
            "“ ‘The economic recovery is still very fragile and any larger repercussions between the U.S. and China could put a halt to the equity rally quite quickly.’ ”",
            "The overall action in U.S. stocks has tilted higher since the indexes put in March 23 lows but has become more cautious as catalysts to take stocks substantially in either direction for a sustained period have failed to materialize.",
            "Could China and U.S. tensions ultimately trigger a fresh eruption? It’s impossible to know how this current political situation will play out, but the conflict bears watching, some experts say.",
            "“The renewed tension between the U.S. and China certainly reignites a risk to the market that had taken a bit of a back burner during the pandemic crisis,” Katie Nixon, CIO at Northern Trust Wealth Management, told MarketWatch.",
            "“Coming in the midst of a recession, we expect that these tensions will contribute to market volatility, particularly as we head toward the U.S. Presidential election,” she said.",
            "“After a 30% plus rally from the March lows, the bar is definitely much higher. As the worries with China heat up, we do think investors could be a little too complacent here and now,” said Ryan Detrick, senior market strategist at LPL Financial.",

            "With 2020 being a presidential election year in the U.S., some strategists note that the U.S.-China relationship may serve as a centerpiece on the virtual campaign trail.",
            "Evercore IS analysts Sarah Bianchi and Don Straszheim say that since January, the share of U.S. voters who say China is an “enemy” has risen to 31%, while the percent who say China is either an ally or friend has fallen to 23%.",
            "“President Trump needs to increase turnout of his base voters in Michigan, Wisconsin or Pennsylvania to secure reelection and this issue provides the perfect fodder,” the analysts write in a summary of recent discussion on the role of China policy in the election.",
            "“It also enables [Trump] to deflect criticism on his COVID-19 response and attack Vice President [Joe] Biden to try to make the election a choice between the two of them — rather than a referendum on coronavirus,” the analysts wrote.",
            "“ ‘I think the next 3-6 weeks could see the most meaningful decline since the March 23 bear market bottom. If that’s the case, the Dow should breach its May low and head to 22,000 at a minimum.’ ”",
            "Other strategists make the case that the U.S. is likely to rework its supply chains away from China, on the heels of its phase-one trade agreement. If that is to be believed then the continuing China strife may be less of impact, some speculate.",
            "“My view has been and continues to be that we will launch an aggressive plan to rebuild supply chains over here (along with infrastructure spending),” Peter Tchir, head of macro strategy at Academy Securities, explained to MarketWatch.",
            "“So, from a markets standpoint I think partly noise, but more because we will be heading away from China anyway,” he said.",
            "Reworking supply chains may assume that the global economy returns to some semblance of normalcy in the wake of the world-wide public-health crisis.",
            "In any case, Paul Schatz, the president of Heritage Capital, told MarketWatch that investors should brace for an equity slump in the next few weeks that could be triggered by disappointment about reopening the economy or some other catalyst.",
            "“I think the next 3-6 weeks could see the most meaningful decline since the March 23 bear market bottom. If that’s the case, the Dow should breach its May low and head to 22,000 at a minimum,” he said.",
            "That said, Schatz is upbeat on the market over the longer term and predicts that the Dow will hit 30,000 and the overall market will be “double-digits higher” in the coming 9-12 month period.",
            "As for China, Schatz says he believes Trump is unlikely to jeopardize deepening the economic pain the U.S. is facing by locking horns with his counterpart President Xi Jinping.",
            "“I don’t think Trump et al will do anything to further jeopardize the economy and what will be a nascent recovery. In other words, I think this is just saber rattling for the most part,”",

            "When the S&P first cleared the 200-day in June 2009 as we were coming out of that major bear market and the financial crises, the index stalled and then pulled back about 7%, riding on the top of the declining 200-day for about a month. The index retook the 200-day in June 2010, after a swift decline, paused, and then fell to new corrective lows.",
            "The 200-day was overtaken in August 2010, and rolled over again. After the major correction in 2011, the “500” rose back above the 200-day for 2 days and then fell 9.8%.We saw similar price action in 2015 and 2016 as the late rally over the 200-day in October 2015 failed miserably.",
            "“One would think that after a big correction or bear market, and then a retaking of this key average, the bulls would go wild, the bears would capitulate, and the stock market would go into outer space. NOT!” he wrote.",
            "Some chart watchers, however, remain encouraged by the market’s recent action and see scope for solid gains, at least in the short term, if the S&P 500 clears resistance at the average.",
            "The index’s close above a short-term double top at 2,955 earlier this week put the focus on the 200-day average, said George Davis, chief technical analyst at RBC Capital Markets, in a note (see chart below).",
            "While some selling interest is likely around that level, the market isn’t overbought, which means the “risk-on” momentum could power the index to further gains. A successful test of the average would put the 3,050 area in focus, he said, in a note, followed by 3,110, which would mark a 76.4% retracement of the February-March selloff."
